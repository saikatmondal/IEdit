4 I want to use a track-bar to change a form's opacity. This is my code: When I try to build it, I get this error: Cannot implicitly convert type 'decimal' to 'double'. I tried making trans a double, but then the control doesn't work. This code has worked fine for me in VB.NET in the past.
9 Given a DateTime representing a person's birthday, how do I calculate their age?

19 Solutions welcome in any language. :-) I'm looking for the fastest way to obtain the value of pi, as a personal challenge. More specifically I'm using ways that don't involve using #defined constants like M_PI, or hard-coding the number in. The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable; I've included it as a baseline to compare the other versions against. In my tests, with built-ins, the 4 * atan(1) version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the atan(1) into a constant. With -fno-builtin specified, the atan2(0, -1) version is fastest. Here's the main testing program (pitimes.c): And the inline assembly stuff (fldpi.c), noting that it will only work for x86 and x64 systems: And a build script that builds all the configurations I'm testing (build.sh): Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too, because the optimisations are different), I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. The atan2(0, -1) version still comes out top every time, though. I'm keen to hear what results you have, as well as improvements to the testing process. :-)
25 I've been having issues getting the C sockets API to work properly in C++. Specifically, although I am including sys/socket.h, I still get compile time errors telling me that AF_INET is not defined. Am I missing something obvious, or could this be related to the fact that I'm doing this coding on z/OS and my problems are much more complicated? Update: Upon further investigation, I discovered that there is an #ifdef that I'm hitting. Apparently z/OS isn't happy unless I define which "type" of sockets I'm using with: Now, I personally have no idea what this _OE_SOCKETS is actually for, so if any z/OS sockets programmers are out there (all 3 of you), perhaps you could give me a rundown of how this all works?
173 I've been wanting to get my databases under version control. Does anyone have any advice or recommended articles to get me started?
264 I've read the manual and know how to set the number of locks, lockers, database page size, etc., but I'd just like some advice from someone who has real-world experience with BDB concurrency. My application is pretty simple, I'll be doing gets and puts of records that are about 1KB each. No cursors, no deleting.
588 I'm writing a CMS application in PHP and one of the requirements is that it must be able to interface with the customer's Exchange server. I've written up this functionality a few times before and have always used WebDAV to do it, but now I'm leaning away from that. I will be running the site on IIS OR Apache (no preference) on Windows server 2008. A few things I would need to do include adding contacts to a given user's address book, sending emails as a given user and running reports on contacts for a user. All of this is pretty easy to do with WebDAV, but if there is a better way that doesn't require any functionality that is likely to be deprecated any time soon. Any ideas? ###Update: Justin, I love the idea of using com objects, I just worry about maintaining a 3rd product to make everything work... John, I can write a web service in C# to interface with for these functions and access it with my PHP app, but it's also a little bit out of the way. So far, I'm not 100% convinced that either of these is better than WebDAV... Can anyone show me where I'm being silly? Thanks, both of you.
1053 Most mathematicians agree that e ** (Ï€i) + 1 = 0. However, most floating point implementations disagree. How well can we settle this dispute? I'm keen to hear about different languages and implementations, and various methods to make the result as close to zero as possible. Be creative!
1306 I'd like to create a progress bar to indicate the status of an a batch job in Ruby. I've read some tutorials / libraries on using ncurses, none of which were particularly helpful in explaining how create an "animated" progress bar in the terminal or using curses with Ruby. I'm already aware of using a separate thread to monitor the progress of a given job, I'm just not sure how to proceed with drawing a progress bar. Update ProgressBar class was incredibly straight-forward, perfectly solved my problem.

1669 I am looking for some helpful books/tutorials on how to write your own compiler simply for educational purposes. I am most familiar with C/C++, Java, and Ruby so I prefer resources that involve one those three, but any good resource is acceptable. If I forgot something already posted let me know in the comments or if you can edit the question yourself then go ahead and add it. I do plan on making it more organized than simply having a large list, but for now I'll use this as a start. Thank you everyone for your answers and if you find another good resource be sure to post it.
1711 If you could go back in time and tell yourself to read a specific book at the beginning of your career as a developer, which book would it be? I expect this list to be varied and to cover a wide range of things. For me, the book would be Code Complete. After reading that book, I was able to get out of the immediate task mindset and begin to think about the bigger picture, quality and maintainability. EDIT: Before adding a another book/answer, please search for it first and upvote the existing answer rather than adding it again. To search, use the search box in the upper-right corner. To search the answers of the current question, use inquestion:this. For example:

2815 I would like to make a nightly cron job that fetches my stackoverflow page and diffs it from the previous day's page, so I can see a change summary of my questions, answers, ranking, etc. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the right set of cookies, etc, to make this work. Any ideas? Also, when the beta is finished, will my status page be accessible without logging in?
5118 I'm working on a website which will switch to a new style on a set date. The site's built in semantic HTML and CSS, so the change should just require a CSS reference change. I'm working with a designer who will need to be able to see how it's looking, as well as a client who will need to be able to review content updates in the current look as well as design progress on the new look. I'm planning to use a magic querystring value and / or a javascript link in the footer which writes out a cookie to select the new CSS page. We're working in ASP.NET 3.5. Any recommendations? I should mention that we're using IE Conditional Comments for IE8,7,and 6 support. I may create a function that does a replacement:

If so, why? EDIT: If you think they're both equally acceptable, do you think it's best to pick one and stick with it, or is it OK to mix them?
5948 In my web application I have a file which hold the current revision number via $Rev$. This work fine except, if I don't make any changes to that file, it doesn't get committed. Is there anyway I can force a single file to always get committed to the SVN server? I'm using TortoiseSVN for Windows so any code or step-by-step instructions would be helpful.
6729 I probably spend far too much time trying to make my visual interfaces look good, and while I'm pretty adept at finding the right match between usability and style one area I am hopeless at is making nice looking icons. How do you people overcome this (I'm sure common) problem? I'm thinking of things like images on buttons and perhaps most important of all, the actual application icon. Do you rely on third party designers, in or out of house? Or do you know of some hidden website that offers lots of icons for us to use? I've tried Google but I seem to find either expensive packages that are very specific, millions of Star Trek icons or icons that look abysmal at 16x16 which is my preferred size on in-application buttons. Any help/advice appreciated.

7472 Can anyone point me to a good resource (or throw me a clue) to show me how to do databinding to controls (combobox, listbox, etc.) in WPF? I'm at a bit of a loss when all my WinForms niceities are taken away from me, and I'm not all that bright to start with... Many Thanks, my fellow Stackies.
8263 I'm using Visual C++ 2003 to debug a program remotely via TCP/IP. I had set the Win32 exception c00000005, "Access violation," to break into the debugger when thrown. Then, I set it back to "Use parent setting." The setting for the parent, Win32 Exceptions, is to continue when the exception is thrown. Now, when I debug the program, it breaks each time that exception is thrown, forcing me to click Continue to let it keep debugging. How do I get it to stop breaking like this?
8348 Imagine an object you are working with has a collection of other objects associated with it, for example the Controls collection on a WinForm. You want to check for a certain object in the collection, but the collection doesn't have a Contains() method. There are several ways of dealing with this. My question is how poor of a programming practice do you consider the second option be and why? How is the performance of it compared to a loop through the collection?
8585 Is there a way to watch for changes in the ip-address much the same as it is possible to watch for changes to files using the FileSystemWatcher? I'm connecting to a machine via tcp/ip but it takes a while until it gives me an ip-address. I would like to dim out the connect button until I have a valid ip-address.

9508 This should be fine seeing as the CLR hasn't actually changed? The boxes running the C# 2.0 code have had .NET 3.5 rolled out. The background is that we have a windows service (.NET 2.0 exe built with VS2005, deployed to ~150 servers) that dynamically loads assemblies (almost like plug-ins) to complete various work items asked of it. Whenever we roll out a new version of the bus logic, we just drop the assemblies on an FTP server and the windows service knows how to check for, grab and store the latest versions. New assemblies are now built using VS2008 and targetting .NET 2.0, we know that works ok. However we'd like to start taking advantage of C# 3.0 language features such as LINQ and targetting the assemblies against .NET 3.5 without having to build and deploy a new version of the windows service. Update: @lomaxx - those Albahari lads are fiendishly clever aren't they?

10314 Being new to Objective-C (but a long term C/++) programmer I'm looking for advice/recommendations on naming conventions for variables. My personal preference would be to utilize a prefix for instance variables both for clarity within functions and to prevent shadowing of function parameters. However I'm a fan of properties which rules out prefixes (unless you also prefix your property names, which doesn't work too well and looks daft). Similarly I could use the "self.variable" convention, but only if I make EVERYTHING a property. So given the code below what's your preferred naming style for instance/function variables? And if you don't bother, how do you deal with shadowing on function params? Cheers!
10848 Does anybody know if it's possible, and how, to programmatically send a SMS from the iPhone, with the official SDK / Cocoa Touch?
10870 Once I've called DragManager.acceptDrag is there any way to "unaccept" the drag? Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call DragManager.acceptDrag(this) (from a DragEvent.DRAG_OVER handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the DragManager.NONE feedback. However, neither calling DragManager.acceptDrag(null) nor DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE) seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it. Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary.
10905 You should be able to create a generic form: Is valid C#, and compiles. However the designer won't work and the form will throw a runtime exception if you have any images stating that it cannot find the resource. I think this is because the windows forms designer assumes that the resources will be stored under the simple type's name.
11291 Well? I'm slowly learning Objective-C and Cocoa, and the only way I see so far to capture key events in Text Views is to use delegation, but I'm having trouble finding useful documentation and examples on how to implement such a solution. Can anyone point me in the right direction or supply some first-hand help? Thanks in advance!
11686 I have a MySQL query that returns a result with a single column of integers. Is there any way to get the MySQL C API to transfer this as actually integers rather than as ASCII text? For that matter is there a way to get MySQL to do /any/ of the API stuff as other than ASCII text. I'm thinking this would save a bit of time in sprintf/sscanf or whatever else is used as well as in bandwidth.
13857 I've been reading a lot about closures and I think I understand them, but without clouding the picture for myself and others, I was wondering if anyone can explain closures as succinctly and clearly as possible to me and others? I'm looking for a simple explanation that might help me wrap my head around why I should be using them in certain instances.
17670 We have a situation in our product where for a long time some data has been stored in the application's database as SQL string (choice of MS SQL server or sybase SQL anywhere) which was encrypted via the Windows API function [CryptEncrypt.][1] (direct and decryptable) The problem is that CryptEncrypt can produce NULL's in the output, meaning that when it's stored in the database, the string manipulations will at some point truncate the ciphertext. Ideally we'd like to use an algo that will produce cyphertext that doesn't contain NULLs as that will cause the least amount of change to the existing databases (changing a column from string to binary and code to deal with binary instead of strings) and just decrypt existing data and re-encrypt with the new algo at database upgrade time. The algorithm doesn't need to be the most secure, as the database is already in a reasonably secure environment (not an open network / teh interwebs) but does need to bebetter than ROT13 (which I can almost decrypt in my head now!) Cheers edit: btw, any particular reason for changing ciphertext to cyphertext? ciphertext seems more widely used... [1]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379924.aspx

19151 How would one create an iterative function (or iterator object) in python?
20148 I'm working on a projects which involves a lot of database writes, I'd say (70% inserts and 30% reads). This ratio would also include updates which I consider to be one read and one write. The reads can be dirty (e.g. I don't need 100% accurate information at the time of read). The task in question will be doing over 1 million database transactions an hour. I've read a bunch of stuff on the web about the differences between MyISAM and InnoDB, and MyISAM seems like the obvious choice to me for the particular database/tables that I'll be using for this task. From what I seem to be reading, InnoDB is good if transactions are needed since row level locking is supported. Does anybody have any experience with this type of load (or higher)? Is MyISAM the way to go?
20728 Our team develops distributed winform apps. We use ClickOnce for deployment and are very pleased with it. However, we've found the pain point with ClickOnce is in creating the deployments. We have the standard dev/test/production environments and need to be able to create deployments for each of these that install and update separate from one another. Also, we want control over what assemblies get deployed. Just because an assembly was compiled doesn't mean we want it deployed. The obvious first choice for creating deployments is Visual Studio. However, VS really doesn't address the issues stated. The next in line is the SDK tool, Mage. Mage works OK but creating deployments is rather tedious and we don't want every developer having our code signing certificate and password. What we ended up doing was rolling our own deployment app that uses the command line version of Mage to create the ClickOnce manifest files. I'm satisfied with our current solution but is seems like there would be an industry-wide, accepted approach to this problem. Is there?
21229 I'm developing a site in Visual Web Dev Express, and when I run/debug, I'd like to be able to set my application's document root so that I can use safer paths, like "/css/style.css' instead of "css/style.css". How would I accomplish this?

22444 I have this gigantic ugly string and I'm tring to extract pieces from it using regex. In this case, I want to grab everything after "Project Name" up to the part where it says "J0000011:" (the 11 is going to be a different number every time). Here's the regex I've been playing with The problem is that it doesn't stop until it hits the J0000020: at the end. How do I make the regex stop at the first ocurrence of J[0-9]{7}?
23190 I am working on a function to establish the entropy of a distribution. It uses a copula, if any are familiar with that. I need to sum up the values in the array based on which dimensions are "cared about." Example: Consider the following example... I need to do this with an array of 'n' dimensions, which could feasibly be 20. Also, I need to be able to do this, caring about certain dimensions, and collapsing the rest. I am having an especially hard time with this because I cant visualize 20 dimensions :p . If anyone could help me set up some c/c++ code to collapse/sum, I would be very very grateful. Thanks in advance
24797 What is the best way to convert a UTC datetime into local datetime. It isn't as simple as a getutcdate() and getdate() difference because the difference changes depending on what the date is. CLR integration isn't an option for me either. The solution that I had come up with for this problem a few months back was to have a daylight savings time table that stored the beginning and ending daylight savings days for the next 100 or so years, this solution seemed inelegant but conversions were quick (simple table lookup)

25192 I'm looking for a Java library for SWIFT messages. I want to Theoretically, I need to support all SWIFT message types. But at the moment I need MT103+, MT199, MT502, MT509, MT515 and MT535. So far I've looked at two libraries Both libraries allow to accomplish the tasks mentioned above but in both cases I'm not really happy. AnaSys uses a internal XML representation for all SWIFT messages which you need to know in order to access the fields of a message. And you need to operate on the DOM of the XML representation, there is no way to say "get the contents of field '50K' of the SWIFT message". And the Datamation library seems to have the nicer API but does not find all errors. So does anyone know other SWIFT libraries to use?
25259 What is a good complete Regex or some other process that would take "How do you change a title to be part of the url like Stackoverflow?" and turn it into "how-do-you-change-a-title-to-be-part-of-the-url-like-stackoverflow" that is used in the smart urls? The dev environment is I am using is Rails but if there are some other platform specific solutions (.net, php, django), I would love to see those too. I am sure I (or another reader) will come across the same problem on a different platform down the line. -- edit -- I am using custom routes, I am just want to know how to alter the string to all special chars are removed, it's all lowercase, and all whitespace is replaced.
26551 I needed to pass id and password to a cmd (or bat) file at the time of running rather than hardcoding them into the file. Here's how I do it.

Afterward: This is my first attempt to answer my own question which, to hear Jeff discuss it is a "...perfectly acceptable...." way of using SO. I'm just not certain if there's already a format for doing it.

27598 I've deployed some Managed Beans on WebSphere 6.1 and I've managed to invoke them through a standalone client, but when I try to use the application "jconsole" distributed with the standard JDK can can't make it works. Has anyone achieved to connect the jconsole with WAS 6.1? Edit: IBM WebSphere 6.1 it's supossed to support JSR 160 JavaTM Management Extensions (JMX) Remote API. Furthermore, it uses the MX4J implementation (http://mx4j.sourceforge.net). But I can't make it works with neither "jconsole" nor "MC4J". I have the Classpath and the JAVA_HOME correctly setted, so the issue it's not there.
27972 Does JavaScript need access to cookies if AJAX is used? Edit: I'm sorry, I guess a lot of people don't understand the question, as evidenced by the edit to my question & the answers. Microsoft created a way to prevent XSS attacks by disallowing JavaScript access to cookies if Http-Only is specified. FireFox later adopted this. So my question is: If you are using AJAX on a site, like StackOverflow, are Http-Only cookies an option?
28110 I have a large table with 1 million+ records. Unfortunately, the person who created the table decided to put dates in a varchar(50) field. I need to do a simple date comparison - But it fails on the convert(): Apparently there is something in that field it doesn't like, and since there are so many records, I can't tell just by looking at it. How can I properly sanitize the entire date field so it does not fail on the convert()? Here is what I have now:
28150 OK, this kind of follows on from my previous question. What I would really like to do is create some sort of attribute which allows me to decorate a method that will break the build. Much like the Obsolete("reason", true) attribute, but without falsely identifying obsolete code. To clarify: I dont want it to break the build on ANY F6 (Build) press, I only want it to break the build if a method decorated with the attribute is called somewhere else in the code. Like I said, similar to obsolete, but not the same. I know I am not alone in this, since other users want to use it for other reasons. I have never created custom attributes before so it is all new to me!
29511 In Ruby, trying to print out the individual elements of a String is giving me trouble. Instead of seeing each character, I'm seeing their ASCII values instead: I've looked online but can't find any way to get the original "0" back out of it. I'm a little new to Ruby to I know it has to be something simple but I just can't seem to find it.

32747 How do I get today's date in C# in 8/28/2008 format? I need to set a string variable to today's date (preferably without the year), but there's got to be a better way than building it month-/-day one piece at a time. BTW: I'm in the US so M/dd would be correct, e.g. September 11th is 9/11. Note: an answer from kronoz came in that discussed internationalization, and I thought it was awesome enough to mention since I can't make it an 'accepted' answer as well. kronoz's answer

41039 Is there a way to search the latest version of every file in TFS for a specific string or regex? This is probably the only thing I miss from Visual Source Safe... Currently I perform a Get Latest on the entire codebase and use Windows Search, but this gets quite painful with over 1GB of code in 75,000 files. EDIT: Tried the powertools mentioned, but the "Wildcard Search" option appears to only search filenames and not contents. UPDATE: We have implemented a customised search option in an existing MOSS (Search Server) installation. Thanks for the help guys.
67699 I have a master and a development branch, both pushed to GitHub. I've cloned, pulled, and fetched, but I remain unable to get anything other than the master branch back. I'm sure I'm missing something obvious, but I have read the manual and I'm getting no joy at all.
68067 I'm using BlogEngine.NET (a fine, fine tool) and I was playing with the TinyMCE editor and noticed that there's a place for me to create a list of external links, but it has to be a javascript file: external_link_list_url : "example_link_list.js" this is great, of course, but the list of links I want to use needs to be generated dynamically from the database. This means that I need to create this JS file from the server on page load. Does anyone know of a way to do this? Ideally, I'd like to just overwrite this file each time the editor is accessed. Thanks!
69766 I'm working on VS 2005 and something has gone wrong on my machine. Suddenly, out of the blue, I can no longer build deployment files. The build message is: A quick Google search brings up the last 2 lines, but nobody in cyberspace has ever reported the first message before. (Hooray! I'm first at SOMETHING on the 'net!) Other machines in my office are able to do the build. My machine has been able to do the build before. I have no idea what changed that upset the delicate balance of things on my box. I have also tried all the traditional rituals i.e. closing Visual Studio, blowing away all the bin and obj folders, rebooting, etc. to no avail. For simplicity's sake, I created a little "Hello World" app with a deployment file. Herewith the build output: I am using: Again, I have no idea what changed. All I know is that one day everything was working fine; the next day I suddenly can't do any deployment builds at all (though all other projects still compile fine). I posted this on MSDN about a month ago, and they don't seem to know what's going on, either. See http://tinyurl.com/6mo6cb Anyone have any idea what this is about? Thanks! Shaul @Brad Wilson: Thanks, but if you read my original post, you'll see that I already did start an entire solution from scratch, and that didn't help. @deemer: I went through all the pain of uninstalling and reinstalling, even though I didn't have your recommended reading while waiting... and - Misery! - still the same error reappears. It seems that my computer has somehow been branded as unsuitable for doing deployment builds ever again. Does anyone have any idea where this "secret switch" might be? HELP!!! :-o
70579 When creating the id attributes for HTML elements, what rules are there for the value?
71332 I'm making a method combining Scrum with the OpenUP lifecycle and deliverables. I also want to keep the OpenUP disciplines apart from "Project Management". I can "hide" it so that it's not immediately obvious in my generated method site. But when you then navigate to the "Risk List" artefact for example the PM is still seen as contributing, and if you click on the link, you get taken to the PM Discipline page. How can I remove it completely from my method without deleting it from the OpenUP library which I'm consuming?
72769 Based on what I have read in Essential .NET Vol1 The CLR by Don Box, I would expect val2 to be zero since a brand new copy of managed.dll/static.lib is loaded when CreateInstanceAndUnwrap is called. Am I misunderstanding what is happening? The static library does not seem to be respecting the appdomain boundaries since it's unmanaged code. Is there a way to get around this issue other than by creating a brand new process for instantiating Managed? Thank you very much everyone!
74883 Edit: I've tried compiling the file according to the readme on the site and I've tried to add extra libs to reduce the link errors. Ive got the following installed: I run the following command line: Then I get the following errors: I'm not too much of a C guru, so any help in finding these unresolved external symbols will be much appreciated!
75526 I understand that some countries have laws regarding website accessibility. In general, what are the minimum requirements that a website must meet to be accessible, regardless of country?
75959 I have used the Entity Framework to start a fairly simple sample project. In the project, I have created a new Entity Data Model from a SQL Server 2000 database. I am able to query the data using LINQ to Entities and display values on the screen. I have an Oracle database with an extremely similar schema (I am trying to be exact but I do not know all the details of Oracle). I would like my project to be able to run on both the SQL Server and Oracle data stores with minimal effort. I was hoping that I could simply change the configuration string of my Entity Data Model and the Entity Framework would take care of the rest. However, it appears that will not work at seamlessly as I thought. Has anyone done what I am trying to do? Again, I am trying to write an application that can query (and update) data from a SQL Server or Oracle database with minimal effort using the Entity Framework. The secondary goal is to not have to re-compile the application when switching back and forth between data stores. If I have to "Update Model from Database" that might be ok because I wouldn't have to recompile, but I'd prefer not to have to go this route. Does anyone know of any steps that might be necessary?
77086 Which is faster, python webpages or php webpages? Does anyone know how the speed of pylons(or any of the other frameworks) compares to a similar website made with php? I know that serving a python base webpage via cgi is slower than php because of its long start up every time. I enjoy using pylons and I would still use it if it was slower than php. But if pylons was faster than php, I could maybe, hopefully, eventually convince my employer to allow me to convert the site over to pylons.
79126 I'm building a function to extend the Enum.Parse concept that So I wrote the following I am getting a Error Constraint cannot be special class 'System.Enum' Fair enough, but is there a workaround to allow a Generic Enum, or am I going to have to mimic the Parse function and pass a type as an attribute, which forces the ugly boxing requirement to your code. EDIT All suggestions below have been greatly appreciated, thanks Have settled on (I've left the loop to maintain case insensitivity - I am usng this when parsing XML)
79923 Programming language books explain that value types are created on the stack, and reference types are created on the heap, without explaining what these two things are. I haven't read a clear explanation of this. I understand what a stack is, but where and what are they (physically in a real computer's memory)?
81008 I know the standard answer is No. However hear out the reasons for wanting it, and then we'll go for whether it is possible to achieve the same effect as ReadyBoost via either enabling (and installing) ReadyBoost or using third party software. Reasons for using Widows Server 2008 as a development environment on a laptop: So all of that equals: Windows Server 2008 (64) on a laptop. Now because we are running Hyper-V, we require a large volume of disk space. This means we are using 5,000 rpm 250GB HDD. So we are on a laptop, we are not able to use solid state HDD, and we only have 4GB of RAM and the throughput of a laptop motherboard rather than a server one... all of which means we are not flying... this thing isn't a sluggard but it's not zippy either. Windows Server 2008 is based on the same code base as Vista. Vista features ReadyBoost, which enables USB 2 flash devices to be used as a weak cache for system files, which visibly increases the performance of Vista. As the codebases are similar, it should be possible for ReadyBoost to work on WS2008, however Microsoft have not shipped or enabled ReadyBoost in WS2008. Given that we are running WS2008 on a laptop as a development environment, how can we achieve the performance gains of ReadyBoost through the use of flash devices in Windows Server 2008? For the answer to be accepted it must outline an end to end process for achieving the performance gain. Answers of 'No' will not be accepted as I understand some third party tools achieve some of the functionality, but I haven't seen a full end-to-end description of how to get going with them.
81459 If I understand correctly, ClickOnce only checks for prerequisites with the first install of an application through the setup.exe file that contains the prerequisite information. If the user opens the app in the future it will check for new versions, but it does not launch the setup.exe again, thus not checking for any NEW prerequisites that might have been added. Is there any way to force ClickOnce to check the prerequisites again or does anyone have a good solution without asking the user to run the setup.exe again?
81584 As a Python newbie, it is interesting to know what IDE's ("GUIs/editors") others use for Python coding. If you can just give the name (e.g. Textpad, Eclipse ..) that will be enough. If it is already mentioned, you can just vote for it. But if you can also give some more comparative information, that will be much appreciated. Thanks. Acronyms used: I don't mention basics like Syntax highlighting as I expect these by default. This is a just dry list reflecting your feedback and comments, I am not advocating any of these tools. I will keep updating this list as you keep posting your answers. PS. Can you help me to add features of the above editors to the list (like autocomplete, debugging, or etc)?

86653 I would like my JSON output in Ruby on Rails to be "pretty" or nicely formatted. Right now, I call the to_json method and my JSON is all on one line. At times this can be difficult to see if there is a problem in the JSON output stream. Is there way to configure or a method to make my JSON "pretty" or nicely formatted in RoR?
87892 There are pages scattered around the web that describe POSIX AIO facilities in varying amounts of detail. None of them are terribly recent. It's not clear what, exactly, they're describing. For example, the "official" (?) web site for Linux kernel asynchronous I/O support here says that sockets don't work, but the "aio.h" manual pages on my Ubuntu 8.04.1 workstation all seem to imply that it works for arbitrary file descriptors. Then there's another project that seems to work at the library layer with even less documentation. I'd like to know: The other multiplexing mechanisms available to me are perfectly good, but the random fragments of information floating around out there have made me curious.
88211 The title should say it all, then I can solidify 2 more ticks on the Joel test. I've implemented build automation using a makefile and a python script already and I understand the basics and the options. But how can I, the new guy who reads the blogs, convince my cohort of its inherent efficacy?
89051 What I'd like to know is if there is a nice way to queue jQuery functions to execute after a set amount of time. This wouldn't pause the execution of other functions, just the ones following in the chain. Perhaps an example of what I'd envisage it would look like would illustrate: I know that it's possible by using timeouts, but it seems like that's a messy way to do it, especially compared to the above example (if it were real). So, is something like this already built-in to jQuery, and if not, what is the best way to emulate it?
89791 When I start my process from VS, it is always created inside a job object. I would like to know how to turn this behaviour off. Any ideas? I expect that it is created in a job object to be debugged. I want to place my program in a different job object. It's not the hosting process. I'm talking about a Job Object. This is an unmanaged C++ application.
90325 we all writing code for single processor. i wonder when we all are able to write code on multi processors? what do we need (software tools, logic, algorithms) for this switching? edit: in my view, as we do many task parallely, same way we need to convert those real life solutions(algorithms) to computer lang. just as OOPs coding did for procedural coding. OOPs is more real life coding style than procedural one. so i hope for that kind of solutions.

94906 I'm running a SQL query on SQL Server 2005, and in addition to 2 columns being queried from the database, I'd also like to return 1 column of random numbers along with them. I tried this: ...which kinda works, but the problem is that this query returns the same random number on every row. It's a different number each time you run the query, but it doesn't vary from row to row. How can I do this and get a new random number for each row?
96463 How do you access the response from the Request object in MooTools? I've been looking at the documentation and the MooTorial, but I can't seem to make any headway. Other Ajax stuff I've done with MooTools I haven't had to manipulate the response at all, so I've just been able to inject it straight into the document, but now I need to make some changes to it first. I don't want to alert the response, I'd like to access it so I can make further changes to it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Edit: I'd like to be able to access the response after the request has already been made, preferably outside of the Request object. It's for an RSS reader, so I need to do some parsing and Request is just being used to get the feed from a server file. This function is a method in a class, which should return the response in a string, but it isn't returning anything but undefined:
97197 The problem is often mentioned in O/R-mapping discussions, and I understand that it has something do to with having to make a lot of database queries for something that seems simple in the object world. Does anybody have a more detailed (but simple!) explanation of the problem?
97459 When a C# WinForms text box receives focus, I want to select all the text in the textbox. To see what I mean, click in your web browser's address bar. See how all text was selected? I want to do that. FASTEST GUN ALERT: please read the following before answering! Thanks guys. :-) Calling .SelectAll() during the .Enter or .GotFocus events won't work because if the user clicked the textbox, the caret will be placed where he clicked, thus deselecting all text. Also, calling .SelectAll() during the .Click event won't work because the user won't be able to select any text with the mouse; the .SelectAll() call will keep overwriting the user's text selection. )

100003 I've mastered almost all the Python concepts (well, let's say they're just OO concepts :-)) but this one is tricky. I know it has something to do with introspection but it's still unclear to me. So what are metaclasses? What do you use them for? Concrete examples, including snippets, much appreciated!
101055 What makes a language a scripting language? I've heard some people say "when it gets interpreted instead of compiled". That would make PHP (for example) a scripting language. It that the only criterion? or is it a coincidence, and are there other criteria?

102567 What's the best way to shutdown the computer from a C# program? I've found a few methods that work - I'll post them below - but none of them are very elegant. I'm looking for something that's simpler and natively .net.
104322 How do you install Boost on MacOS? Right now I can't find bjam for the Mac.
106175 VB.Net has a the very handy "with" statement, but it also lets you use it on an unnamed variable, like this: Is there a way to get at the "hidden" instance, so I can view it's properties in the Immeidate window? I doubt I'll get it in the watch windows, so immediate is fine. If you try to access the instance the same way (say, when .Execute() throws an exception) from the Immediate window, you get an error: Is there any trick that can be used to get this, or do I have to convert the code to another style? If With functioned more like a Using statement, eg. "With v = New FancyClass()", this wouldn't pose a problem. EDIT: I know how with's work, what alternatives exist, what the compiler does, etc. I just want to know if this is possible.
106711 Here's a simplified version of what I'm trying to do : I'm very new with Rails, but this doesn't seem like it ought to be exceedingly hard, so I'm feeling kind of dumb. What I've tried : I have a before_filter redirecting to a private method that looks like the get_string method looks like This fails because i have two render or redirect calls in the same action. I can take out that first respond_to, of course, but what happens is that the controller gets trapped in the get_string method. I can more or less see why that's happening, but I don't know how to fix it and break out. I need to be able to show one form (View), get and then do something with the input string, and then proceed as normal. The get_string.html.erb file looks like I'll be thankful for any help! Thanks for the replies... @Laurie Young : You are right, I was misunderstanding. For some reason I had it in my head that the instance of any given controller invoked by a user would persist throughout their session, and that some of the Rails magic was in tracking objects associated with each user session. I can see why that doesn't make a whole lot of sense in retrospect, and why my attempt to use an instance variable (which I'd thought would persist) won't work. Thanks to you as well :)
108443 I'm planning to create a data structure optimized to hold assembly code. That way I can be totally responsible for the optimization algorithms that will be working on this structure. If I can compile while running. It will be kind of dynamic execution. Is this possible? Have any one seen something like this? Should I use structs to link the structure into a program flow. Are objects better? Update: I think it will turn out, like a linked list. Update: I know there are other compilers out there. But this is a military top secret project. So we cant trust any code. We have to do it all by our self.
109383 I am relatively new to Java, and often find that I need to sort a Map<Key, Value> on the values. Since the values are not unique, I find myself converting the keySet into an array, and sorting that array through array sort with a custom comparator that sorts on the value associated with the key. Is there an easier way?
110175 How can you automatically import the latest build/revision number in subversion? The goal would be to have that number visible on your webpage footer like SO does.
110629 this is a repost of a question not correctly answered -- sorry about that. We are looking for a reasonably priced CMS , with source code, in which we can ditch the portal system. There are notorious examples of something similar which are way too expensive: Methode, Broadvision, Microsoft CMS. There are a lot of systems in which the portal part is too tightly coupled with the backend to do that. Basically Joomla, Drupal, phpNuke, dotNetNuke, Umbraco are all examples of what we don't want. We want a back office system that can store heterogeneous information with versioning, workflow and so on. This information should be statically publishable (to files, xml, etc...). Also we would like to have a set of APIs for accessing the information in a custom front-end. We would use this system in a large number of websites. Platform is not important as we develop sites on multiple stacks. Thank you in advance

113951 I am creating an appcation on Vista,which include a service and a Console application .Both running in same user account In service i am creating an event and waits for that event.In console application i am opening the same event (problem starts here) and calling SetEvent function. I can not open the event (getting error 5,Access is denied) in the console application.I searched in the net and saw something about integrity level (I am not sure that the problem is related to integrity level).Its telling that service and applicaation got differnt integrity levels. here is the part of the code,where IPC occures service Console Application Here in application ,opening the event and seting the event I am running both application (serivce and console application) with administrative privilege (i logged in as Administraor and running the console application by right clicking and using the option "run as administrator") . The error i am getting in console application (where i am opening the event) is error no 5(Access is denied. ) .

114229 I'm trying to write a function that formats every (string) member/variable in an object, for example with a callback function. The variable names are unknown to me, so it must work with objects of all classes. How can I achieve something similar to array_map or array_walk with objects?

116690 SVN keyword substition gives is not pretty.

120693 I've got a function that runs a user generated Regex. However, if the user enters a regex that won't run then it stops and falls over. I've tried wrapping the line in a Try/Catch block but alas nothing happens. If it helps, I'm running jQuery but the codo below does not have it as I'm guessing that it's a little more fundamental than that. Edit: Yes, I know that I am not escaping the "[", that's intentional and the point of the question. I'm accepting user input and I want to find a way to catch this sort of problem without the application falling flat on it's face.
121724 I am looking for some recommendations on good places to find libraries of controls/templates/styles for WPF. I know about the usual places like Infragistics, but it seems to me that there should be some kind of community effort by now to share nice, clean, well written controls for WPF controls. I am not big on the design side, and it would be nice to fill out my personal libraries with some nice examples from people who are better at design. Any ideas/recommendations?
121945 What are your best practices for comments. when to use them and what they should contain. Do we even need them ( I think we do )
122102 What is the most efficient way to clone a JavaScript object? I've seen obj = eval(uneval(o)); being used, but that's non-standard and only supported by Firefox. I've done things like obj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o)); but question the efficiency. I've also seen recursive copying functions with various flaws. I'm surprised no canonical solution exists.
122544 Is there a generic way, without creating and managing your own CLR host, to take over locating and loading a type if that type is not found? The following is just an example. In your rush to be the first answer, don't suggest the new add-in framework or the MEF as a solution to my question. An example would be a sample with add-ins. Your app reads a file in that lists the types to use for a particular function. The app attempts to instantiate those types. If they aren't already currently loaded in the appdomain, the method fails. I'm looking for an event I can handle or a component I can provide my own implementation for that will allow me to gracefully handle these situations and provide additional logic for loading these assemblies.
123559 I'm trying to put together a comprehensive regex to validate phone numbers. Ideally it would handle international formats, but it must handle US formats, including the following: I'll answer with my current attempt, but I'm hoping somebody has something better and/or more elegant.
123817 We are using ActiveMQ 5.2 as our implementation of choice and we picked it a while ago. It performs well enough for our use right now. Since its been a while, I was wondering what other Java Message Service implementations are in use and why? Surely there are more than a few.
124959 Whats the available solutions for PHP to create word document in linux environment?
125022 I am trying to install PHP onto my development box (XP SP3 / IIS 5.1) I've got PHP 5.2.6 stable downloaded (the MSI installer package) and I am getting an error "Cannot find httpd.conf". After that the install seems to breeze by quickly (more quickly than I would have expected) and when I try to execute a simple PHP script from my localhost test directory that I created, I get a slew of missing DLL errors. I have seen posts out there which indicate that its possible and has been done. I dont see any bug reports for this MSI at PHP.NET support. Any ideas?
125523 Is it possible to use an attribute of a child to group a query? Post.find(:all, :include => [ :authors, :comments ], :group=>'authors.city') does not work. However, I am able to use author.city as part of the conditions.

126855 I have two tables, Users and DoctorVisit User DoctorsVisit The doctorVisit table contains all the visits a particular user did to the doctor. The user's weight is recorded per visit. Query: Sum up all the Users weight, using the last doctor's visit's numbers. (then divide by number of users to get the average weight) Note: some users may have not visited the doctor at all, while others may have visited many times. I need the average weight of all users, but using the latest weight.

127869 I am attempting to read a large XML document and I wanted to do it in chucks vs XMLDocument's way of reading the entire file into memory. I know I can use XMLTextReader to do this but I was wondering if anyone has used SAX for .NET? I know Java deveolpers swear by it and I was wondering if it is worth giving it a try and if so what are the benefits in using it. I am looking for specifics. Cheers
128279 I have a wix installer and a single custom action (plus undo and rollback) for it which uses a property from the installer. The custom action has to happen after all the files are on the hard disk. It seems that you need 16 entries in the wxs file for this; eight within the root, like so: And eight within the InstallExecuteSequence, like so: Is there a better way?

137647 I'd like to get a feel for what people are using for IoC containers. I've read some good things about Castle Windsor, but I know a lot of people use StructureMap, Unity, Ninject, etc. What are some of the differences amongst those mentioned (and any I neglected). Strengths? Weaknesses? Better fit (like StructureMap is great for ABC but not so good for XYZ)?
137975 The singleton pattern is a fully paid up member of the GoF's patterns book, but it lately seems rather orphaned by the developer world. I still use quite a lot of singletons, especially for factory classes, and while you have to be a bit careful about multithreading issues (like any class actually), I fail to see why they are so awful. Stack Overflow especially seems to assume that everyone agrees that Singletons are evil. Why?
138771 I'm just meddling in the ways of the RESTful web service in C# using ASP.Net 2.0 and have managed (via a class library, a reference to dll produced by the former and some adjustment of my web.config) to coax out a URI format like so: http: //localhost/DevelopmentProject/testhandler/?input=thisismyinput Which unremarkably just returns the input as a piece of text with the enlightening prefix "Your Input Was: " I was under the impression that I could get the URI to become further ensmoothened to something more along the lines of: http: //localhost/DevelopmentProject/testhandler/thisismyinput and have the same result but have no idea how to get rid of the pesky "?input=" The entry to the httphandlers section of my web.config is (spaces added so code displays): < add verb="*" path="testhandler/*" type="HandlerLib.testhandler, HandlerLib"/ > I am running IIS 5.1 on the local machine, will this introduce a problem? Essentially where am I going wrong? Thanks.
141288 Is it possible to use the Flex Framework and Components, without using MXML? I know ActionScript pretty decently, and don't feel like messing around with some new XML language just to get some simple UI in there. Can anyone provide an example consisting of an .as file which can be compiled (ideally via FlashDevelop, though just telling how to do it with the Flex SDK is ok too) and uses the Flex Framework? For example, just showing a Flex button that pops open an Alert would be perfect. If it's not possible, can someone provide a minimal MXML file which will bootstrap a custom AS class which then has access to the Flex SDK?

147391 I have a program that uses the mt19937 random number generator from boost::random. I need to do a random_shuffle and want the random numbers generated for this to be from this shared state so that they can be deterministic with respect to the mersenne twister's previously generated numbers. I tried something like this: But i get a template error calling random_shuffle with rand. However this works: Probably because it is an actual function call. But obviously this doesn't keep the state from the original mersenne twister. What gives? Is there any way to do what I'm trying to do without global variables?
148403 Is it possible to convert UTF8 string in a std::string to std::wstring and vice versa in a platform independent manner? In a Windows application I would use MultiByteToWideChar and WideCharToMultiByte. However, the code is compiled for multiple OSes and I'm limited to standard C++ library.

151777 I've been working on Android SDK platform, and it is a little unclear how to save an application's state. So given this minor re-tooling of the 'Hello, Android' example: I thought it would be enough for the simplest case, but it always responds with the first message, no matter how I navigate away from the app. I'm sure the solution is as simple as overriding onPause or something like that, but I've been poking away in the documentation for 30 minutes or so and haven't found anything obvious.

153021 I need to generate an XML file in C#. I want to write the code that generates this in a file that is mostly Xml with code inside of it as I can in an ASP.NET MVC page. So I want a code file that looks like: This would generate my XML file. I would not mind using part of System.Web if someone tells me how I can do it without IIS overhead or kludging a generation of a web file. I want to use templating and I want templating that is similar to ASP.NET
153724 What I would like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method - i.e. if the decimal to be rounded is 5, it always rounds up to the previous number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations. I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes. I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method: returns: which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: returns: Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter: returns: However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this: What is the best way to achieve this in Java?

157354 I happened to debate with a friend during college days whether advanced mathematics is necessary for any veteran programmer. He used to argue fiercely against that. He said that programmers need only basic mathematical knowledge from high school or fresh year college math, no more no less, and that almost all of programming tasks can be achieved without even need for advanced math. He argued, however, that algorithms are fundamental & must-have asset for programmers. My stance was that all computer science advances depended almost solely on mathematics advances, and therefore a thorough knowledge in mathematics would help programmers greatly when they're working with real-world challenging problems. I still cannot settle on which side of the arguments is correct. Could you tell us your stance, from your own experience?
157832 This is sort of SQL newbie question, I think, but here goes. I have a SQL Query (SQL Server 2005) that I've put together based on an example user-defined function: the UDF works great (it concatenates data from multiple rows in a related table, if that matters at all) but I'm confused about the "i" after the FROM clause. The query works fine with the i but fails without it. What is the significance of the "i"? EDIT: As Joel noted below, it's not a keyword
159255 Bearing in mind that I'll be performing calculations on lat / long pairs, what datatype is best suited for use with a MySQL database?
159590 I've used recursion quite a lot on my many years of programming to solve simple problems, but I'm fully aware that sometimes you need iteration due to memory/speed problems. So, sometime in the very far past I went to try and find if there existed any "pattern" or text-book way of transforming a common recursion approach to iteration and found nothing. Or at least nothing that I can remember it would help.
162325 This has been an adventure. I started with the looping duplicate query located in my previous question, but each loop would go over all 17 million records...meaning it would take weeks (just running select count * from MyTable takes my server 4:30 minutes => mssql 2005). I gleamed information from this site and at this post: http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/jeffs/archive/2007/03/28/60146.aspx And have arrived at the query below. The question is, is this the correct type of query to run on 17 million records for any type of performance? If it isn't, what is? SQL QUERY:
162576 I've been battling PHP's email reading functions for the better part of two days. I'm writing a script to read emails from a mailbox and save any attachments onto the server. If you've ever done something similar, you might understand my pain: PHP doesn't play well with email! I've connected to the POP3 server and I can iterate the files. Here's a rough outline of the code: I've marked where I'm stuck. I can use imap_fetchbody($mbox, $message->msgno, $key+1) but that gets me a bunch of data like this: I'm lead to believe that this is MIME data. I need it as an image! I've seen several classes bombing around the internet that claim to do the required wizardry. I can't get any of them to work. I don't understand why I'm finding this so hard! In short, I'm looking for something that can turn a raw MIME string into real data.

166221 I would like to upload a file asynchronously with jQuery. This is my HTML: And here my Jquery code: Instead of the file being uploaded, I am only getting the filename. What can I do to fix this problem? I am using the jQuery Form Plugin to upload files.
166639 Currently, I'm in the process of hiring a web developer who will be working on a site that processes credit cards. While he won't have the credentials to log into the payment gateway's UI he will have access to the API login and transaction key since it's embedded in the application's code. I'd like to be aware of all the "what if" scenarios pertaining to the type of damage one could do with that information. Obviously, he can process credit cards but the money goes into the site owner's bank account so I'm not sure how much damage that could cause. Can anyone think of any other possible scenarios? UPDATE: The payment gateway being used is Authorize.net.
166750 I'm designing a small SQL database to be used by a web application. Let's say a particular table has a Name field for which no two rows will be allowed to have the same value. However, users will be able to change the Name field at any time. The primary key from this table will be used as a foreign key in other tables. So if the Name field was used as the PK, any changes would need to be propogated to those other tables. On the other hand, the uniqueness requirement would be handled automatically. My instinct would be to add an integer field to act as the PK, which could be automatically populated by the database. Is there any point in having this field or would it be a waste of time?
166802 Has anyone ever had the issue where trying to "View Designer" on a windows form in Visual Studio .NET causes the error: "Could not load file or assemblyâ€¦" ? In this case, the assembly in question was XYZ.dll. I managed to fix this by adding XYZ.dll and all its references to my project's references (even though my project doesn't directly depend on them) and rebuilding the whole solution. However, after that, I removed all those references from my project, rebuilt, and it still worked. One other piece of information is that I use Resharper 2.5. Someone else pointed out that it might be Resharper doing some shadow copying. I'll look into this next time this happens. Does anyone have a understanding of why this error happens in the first place, and possibly the 'correct' way to fix it?
167569 I can't seem to get my application up and running on my dev server and I'm not sure why. I have compiled my code in VS 2008 with a target framework of 3.5. I am using 3.5 mainly because I have implemented LINQ rather extensively. Compiling and runs local without any problems. The hang up is that my server only has the 2.0 .Net framework and upgrading to 3.5 is apparently not going to happen. I was under the impression after doing some research that as long as I was trying to execute compiled code the server would not need 3.5 installed. Today I am trying to publish to the server and I can't get past this error in my WEB.CONFIG Configuration Error Parser Error Message: Child nodes not allowed. providerOption name="CompilerVersion" value="v3.5"/ EDIT ADD ON QUESTION: I have seen some posts about possibly setting my references to "copy local" which might allow me to run on the 2.0 server. Thoughts?
167888 I need to be able to GZip compress a file in an Excel VBA function. Specifically I need to be able to use the 'deflate' algorithm. Is there a way to do this without having to exec a command line application? With no dependency on external tools the code will be more robust. Ideally the code would make use of pre-installed VBA or COM library functions - I don't want to have to implement this logic myself or install DLLs etc. If possible, I want installation of the function to be as simple as adding a .xla to the available Excel Add-Ins. No DLLs, EXEs, registry entries etc. required.
170019 I have an API that is dependent on certain state information between requests. As an easy first version of the code, I am simply using PHP session's to store the state information instead of something more advanced (APC, memcache, DB). Throughout my initial testing in a web browser, everything worked perfectly. However, it seems that when clients try to connect through non-browser methods such as Curl or wget, the state information is not being preserved. Will a PHP session only be created if a browser is requesting the page? I am explicitly starting the session with session_start() as well as naming it before hand with session_name().
171251 I need to be able to merge two (very simple) JavaScript objects at runtime. For example I'd like to: Does anyone have a script for this or know of a built in way to do this? I do not need recursion, and I do not need to merge functions, just methods on flat objects.
171301 I have only code.
172465 I have those commands in the 1.cmd file. First three are executely finely. The result of it is that after sdp describe Integration.dpk &pause is executed I'm given "press any key to continue...". After I hit any key, the command prompt quits instead of changing drive to z:\>. What is wrong with it?
173133 How can I reinterpret cast a float to a int (or a double to a long)? float f = 2.0f; int i = (int)f; // causes conversion I only want to copy the bit-pattern from f to i. How can this be done? 2. The implicit and explicit operators in C# uses one intermediate object because the operator function is 'static' public static implicit operator MyClass(double s) { return new MyClass(s); } .. .. MyCLass m = 2.2; // this code uses 'm' and one intermediate object. This is fine for reference types, but for value-types which are big (say 20-30 bytes), this will cause unnecessary data copy. Is my understanding correct? And If yes, then why doesn't C# have a non-static conversion operator or user-defined assignment operator so that the conversion/assignment takes place on 'this'? If it does, whats the way to do it? Thanks
176331 I've developed a windows application that uses shared memory---that is---memory mapped files for interprocess communication. I have a windows service that does some processing and periodically writes data to the memory mapped file. I have a separate windows application that reads from the memory mapped file and displays the information. The application works as expected on Windows XP, XP Pro and Server 2003, but NOT on Vista. I can see that the data being written to the memory mapped file is happening correctly by the windows service because I can open the file with a text editor and see the stored messages, but the "consumer" application can't read from the file. One interesting thing to note here, is that if I close the consumer application and restart it, it consumes the messages that were previously written to the memory mapped file. Also, another strange thing is that I get the same behavior when I connect to the windows host using Remote Desktop and invoke/use the consumer application through remote desktop. However, if I invoke the Remote Desktop and connect to the target host's console session with the following command: mstsc -v:servername /F -console, everything works perfectly. So that's why I think the problem is related to permissions. Can anyone comment on this? EDIT: The ACL that I'm using to create the memory mapped file and the Mutex objects that sychronize access is as follows: I think this may be part of the issue.

181953 I'm a long-time C#/.NET programmer but totally new to WPF and the System.Windows.Controls namespace and XAML. The more I learn about it the more I realize that you can do pretty much all of your GUI initialization and event handling glue in either XAML or in code (say C# code or VB.Net code). My question is to those who have been working on WPF for longer and ideally those who have shipped apps with it -- where did you find was the best place to 'draw the line' between XAML and code? Did you use XAML wherever you could? Only where interfacing with non-coding UI designers? Any tips in this area would be extremely helpful to myself and other coders who are just getting into WPF programming and are kind of paralyzed by all the choices we can make!
199418 I have a C++ library that provides various classes for managing data. I have the source code for the library. I want to extend the C++ API to support C function calls so that the library can be used with C code and C++ code at the same time. I'm using GNU tool chain (gcc, glibc, etc), so language and architecture support are not an issue. Are there any reasons why this is technically not possible? Are there any gotcha's that I need to watch out for? Are there resources, example code and/or documentation available regarding this? Thanks :UPDATE: Some other things that I have found out: Keep "real" C++ interfaces in separate header files that are not included by C. Think PIMPL principle here. Using #ifndef __cplusplus #error stuff helps here to detect any craziness. Careful of C++ identifiers as names in C code Enums varying in size between C and C++ compilers. Probably not an issue if you're using GNU tool chain, but still, be careful. For structs follow the following form so that C does not get confused. typedef struct X { ... } X Then use pointers for passing around C++ objects, they just have to be declared in C as struct X where X is the C++ object. All of this is courtesy of a friend who's a wizard at C++.
199918 I have been trying to explain the difference between switch statements and pattern matching(F#) to a couple of people but I haven't really been able to explain it well..most of the time they just look at me and say "so why don't you just use if..then..else". How would you explain it to them? EDIT! Thanks everyone for the great answers, I really wish I could mark multiple right answers.
200439 I'm sorry for this very newbish question I'm not much given into web development. I've got this cool javascript on a .js file that we want to use at a small web site.

201183 A strict equality operator will tell you if two object types are equal, however, is there any way to tell if two objects are equal, much like the hash code value in Java? This is similar to this question, but requires a more academic answer: Is there any kind of hash code function in JavaScript? The scenario above demonstrates why it would be necessary to have one, and I'm wondering if there is any equivalent solution.

204572 I currently work for a bespoke software agency. Does anyone have any experience of how to win well priced work. It seems there is so much competition from offshore/bedroom program teams, that cost is extremely competetive these days. I feel that it is very different compared to a software product company or an internal it department, in terms of budget. As someone else said before, we only ever really get to version 1.0 of a lot of our software, unless the client is big enough. In which case it doesn't make business sense to spend ages making the software the best we can. Its like we are doing the same quality of work of internal it. Also a Lot of our clients are not technically minded and so therefor will not pay for things they don't understand. As our company does not have the money to turn down work it often goes that we take on complicated work for far too little money. I have got a lot better at managing change and keeping tight specs etc. It is still hard.
206384 I'm taking my first crack at Ajax with jQuery. I'm getting my data onto my page, but I'm having some trouble with the JSON data that is returned for Date data types. Basically, I'm getting a string back that looks like this: From someone totally new to JSON - How do I format this to a short date format? Should this be handled somewhere in the jQuery code? I've tried the jQuery.UI.datepicker plugin using $.datepicker.formatDate() without any success. FYI: Here's the solution I came up with using a combination of the answers here: This solution got my object from the callback method and displayed the dates on the page properly using the date format library.
207513 Is there any tool that enables you to "hot swap" JavaScript contents while executing a webpage? I am looking for something similar to what HotSport does for Java, a way to "hot deploy" new JS code without having to reload the whole page. Is there anything like that out there? Clarifying in case people don't understand "hot swap", as indicated by lock: By "hot swap" I mean allowing me to change pars of the code contained on the .js files included on a given page, reloading the code dynamically. That kind of approach simplifies debugging and error fixing, since you don't need to reload the page and start the interaction all over again, from scratch.

211383 I have the age-old problem of a div wrapping a two-column layout. My sidebar is floated, so my container div fails to wrap the content and sidebar. There seem to be numerous methods of fixing the clear bug in Firefox: In my situation, the only one that seems to work correctly is the <br clear="all"/> solution, which is a little bit scruffy. overflow:auto gives me nasty scrollbars, and overflow:hidden must surely have side effects. Also, IE7 apparently shouldn't suffer from this problem due to its incorrect behaviour, but in my situation it's suffering the same as Firefox. Which method currently available to us is the most robust?
212264 I would like to know if there are general rules for creating an index or not. How do I choose which fields I should include in this index or when not to include them?

220423 From time to time, I run into communications issue with other programmers, when we talk about NULL. Now NULL could be a NULL pointer the NUL character an empty data element in some sort of database. NUL seems to be the most confusing. It is the ASCII character 0x00. I tend to use '\0' in my code to represent it. Some developers in my group tend to prefer to simply use 0, and let the compiler implicitly cast it to a char. What do you prefer to use for NUL? and why?

226103 My printer ran out of black toner and I didnâ€™t have a spare, so I thought itâ€™d be a good idea to â€œprintâ€? documents to .XPS files for now, then print them when the new toner arrives. So, now I have my toner but I canâ€™t work out how to print the files. I found this great post on Tim Barczâ€™s blog which seems to indicate Iâ€™m not alone: http://www.timbarcz.com/blog/HowToPrintXPSDocumentsEasyAs11a1aI233a45.aspx I can open them and view them in IE, but if I try to print them it either ignores the command altogether or crashes. I downloaded the XPS Essentials Pack from the Microsoft website and tried to install it, but it refuses to install and keeps crashing with a ten-page error message. Ironically, I would normally print this message out to deal with it. My â€œsolutionâ€? is to open the .XPS files in IE, then screenshot them and paste them into Paint Shop Pro so I can print them as graphics. As Tim Barcz says in his post that I linked to:

228783 It's common in C++ to name member variables with some kind of prefix to denote the fact that they're member variables, rather than local variables or parameters. If you've come from an MFC background, you'll probably use m_foo. I've also seen myFoo occasionally. C# (or possibly just .NET) seems to recommend using just an underscore, as in _foo. Is this allowed by the C++ standard?
230715 Alright, after doing a ton of research and trying almost every managed CPP Redist I can find as well as trying to copy my DLLs locally to the executing directory of the app I cannot figure out what dependencies i'm missing for this mixed mode library. Basically I have a large C# application and I'm trying to use a mixed mode library I made. On the development machine it works perfect (of course) but deployed when the library needs to be loaded for use it exceptions out because of missing CRT dependencies (I assume). I have used dependency walker to check all the DLLs referenced and ensured they exist on the deployment machine with no luck, I'm wondering if maybe it's some dependencies that need to be registered that I am missing, but i can't figure out what. I get the following exception when code tries to instantiate a class from the mixed mode library. Exception Detail: System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'USADSI.MAPI, Version=1.0.3174.25238, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. This application has failed to start because the application configuration is incorrect. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800736B1) I am compiling the library using VS2008 SP1 with /clr:oldSyntax specified. The intermediate manifest looks like this: I can provide any more information as needed, unfortunately i'm not well versed in making mixed mode libraries so this has thrown me off. If anyone can offer any advice I would greatly appreciate it!

238452 I am familiar with C++ RTTI, and find the concept interesting. Still there exist a lot of more ways to abuse it than to use it correctly (the RTTI-switch dread comes to mind). As a developer, I found (and used) only two viable uses for it (more exactly, one and a half). Could you share some of the ways RTTI is a viable solution to a problem, with example code/pseudo-code included?

239278 HI i have database with many tables. In the first table i have a field called status. other tables could have same idno with different fields. I want to check the status for each id no and if it is yes then for that id number in all tables for all null and blank fields i want to update them as 111111. I am looking for a sample vba code for this which i can adapt. Thanks
239395 Is it possible to easily embed ActiveX controls in Java application? Is it worth it. In my next project I should either use existing activex in Java app or have to reimplement everything from scratch, so I'm wondering what will be less hassle.

240178 I needed to create a list of lists in Python, so I typed the following: The list looked like this: Then I changed one of the innermost values: Now my list looks like this: which is not what I wanted or expected. Can someone please explain what's going on, and how to get around it?
240258 Ok, I am reading in dat files into a byte array. For some reason, the people who generate these files put about a half meg's worth of useless null bytes at the end of the file. Anybody know a quick way to trim these off the end? First thought was to start at the end of the array and iterate backwards until I found something other than a null, then copy everything up to that point, but I wonder if there isn't a better way. To answer some questions: Are you sure the 0 bytes are definitely in the file, rather than there being a bug in the file reading code? Yes, I am certain of that. Can you definitely trim all trailing 0s? Yes. Can there be any 0s in the rest of the file? Yes, there can be 0's other places, so, no, I can't start at the beginning and stop at the first 0.
241193 Is there a .dll version of the inclued extension for PHP? The manual's link for Inclued on PECL4WIN doesn't help. I don't have a compiler to build my own DLL. NOTE: The spelling "inclued" is correct!
241274 I'm using IXMLDOM in MSXML 6 to build an XML file in a C++ MFC application. Is there a way to see the contents of the xml document while it is in memory? For example, an XPATH query is failing about halfway through creating the file. How would I view the entire contents of the xml doc? Thanks, Steve
242225 I always hear that programmers try to pick the right tool for the job. I've never programmed in Java, so I was wondering What are its benefits? Why is it so popular? What should I use it for? I just program recreationally. Is there anything about it that makes it particularly fun??
244110 Here's the code. Not much to it. Create a new workbook, add a blank worksheet to it, dump it to the browser. The issue is that I get the following error when I actually open the file with Excel: Even stranger is the fact that, despite the error, the file seems fine. Any data I happen to be writing is there. Any ideas on how to get rid of this error? ###Edit I've modified the code sample to better illustrate the problem. I don't think the first sample was a legit test.
244439 You have several maintenance branches for existing releases of your software. Some developers are making direct changes in the maintenance branches, and merging periodically into the trunk. Now comes an extensive refactoring in the trunk codeline, scheduled for an upcoming major release. But this makes the maintenance branches fundamentally incompatible with the code in the trunk, as they might depend on code that does not exist anymore, for example. How do you deal with this situation in practice?
245223 I'm working with a small FAT16 filesystem, and I want to generate CRC values for indidual XML files which store configuration information. In case the data changes or is corrupted, I want to be able to check the CRC to determine that the file is still in it's original state. The question is, how do I put the CRC value into the file, without changing the CRC value of the file itself? I can think of a couple solutions, but I think there must be a fairly standard solution for this issue.
247621 What are the correct version numbers for C#? What came out when? Why can't I find any answers about C# 3.5? [This question is primarily to aid those who are searching for an answer using an incorrect version number, e.g. "C# 3.5". At the time of this writing, there are several questions tagged with "c#3.5". I'm shortly going to correct this, as recommended by the answer to this question about terminology. The hope is that anyone failing to find an answer with the wrong version number will find this answer and then search again with the right version number.] EDIT: I've now retagged all of the questions marked "c#3.5" to c#-3.0 and "c#4" to c#-4.0. If those of us who care about this could try to keep an eye out for new questions with those tags, that would be handy :)

249536 FindBugs has found a potential bug in my code. But it is not a bug. Is it possible to mark this occurrence as 'not a bug' AND have it removed from the bug list? I have documented quite clearly why for each case it is not a bug. For example. A class implements the comparable interface. it has the compareTo method. I have however not overridden the equals method. FindBugs does not like this as the JavaDocs state that it is recommended that Although in my case the above condition is and always will be true.
249916 The java.net.InetAddress.GetByName(String host) method can only return A records so to lookup other record types I need to be able to send DNS queries using the dnsjava library. However that normally relies on being able to parse /etc/resolv.conf or similar to find the DNS server addresses and that doesn't work on Android. The current DNS settings on Android can apparently only be obtained from within a shell by using the getprop command. Can anyone tell me how to get those settings from Java other than by spawning a shell with Runtime.exec() and parsing the output from getprop?
249985 As the title says, I have a Windows app written in C++ from which I need to make calls to remote Thrift services, and I'm a bit lost on the subject, to be honest. http://wiki.apache.org/thrift/ThriftInstallationWin32 states that "The Thrift C++ runtime library does not currently work on Windows". Does that mean I'm shit out of luck, or is there a workaround?
253284 I am having dependency troubles. I have two classes: Graphic and Image. Each one has its own .cpp and .h files.

253664 We've got products built both with GUI and CHUI. Going forward, we're looking at redesigning a lot of our software and mainly taking the route of going all GUI. My question to the group is, do we need to account for keeping a CHUI around? What are the advantages of CHUI over GUI? Many times in the past people have said that CHUI is faster because you don't need a mouse. I argue that GUI can be just as fast with the right keyboard shortcuts, hotkeys and/or touch screens. Is CHUI something we should no longer consider if hardware no longer provides a constraint? Also to clarify, when I speak about CHUI I mean a CHaracter based User Interface, and I'm also mainly concerned with the effective presentation of data to an end user. There have been some fantastic responses that have highlighted the importance of having a command line based interface for automation and scripting based tasks which I will certainly take to heart when we begin the design!
254273 Why does this lambda expression not compile? Conjecture is fine, but I would really appreciate references to the C# language specification or other documentation.

257418 Possible Duplicate: Why are there sometimes meaningless do/while and if/else statements in C/C++ macros? I've been seeing that expression for over 10 years now. I've been trying to think what it's good for. Since I see it mostly in #defines, I assume it's good for inner scope variable declaration and for using breaks (instead of gotos.) Is it good for anything else? Do you use it?
258728 When I try to create a new task in the task scheduler via the Java ProcessBuilder class I get an access denied error an Windows Vista. On XP it works just fine. When I use the "Run as adminstrator" option it runs on Vista as well.. However this is a additional step requeried an the users might not know about this. When the user just double clicks on the app icon it will fail with access denied. My question is how can I force a java app to reuest admin privileges right after startup?
258954 Java is nearing version 7 ... I occurs to me that there there must be plenty of textbooks and training manuals kicking around that teach methods based on older versions of Java; where the methods taught, would have far better solutions now .... ###What are some boilerplate code situations, especially ones that you see people implement through force of habit, that you find yourself refactoring to utilise the latest versions of Java?
259753 I can't get the inner div (with Hello World) to fit inside the "box" div in this code example (also at http://www.toad-software.com/test.html). Despite the body being set to 100%, the inner div will not be contained! This is a test case for a larger project in which a variable-width table exceeds the boundaries of its container. The table would be in the inner div and the container would the "box."

260235 Consider the following simple C program that read a file into a buffer and displays that buffer to the console: The file it will read simply contains: Hello World! The output is: Hello World!Â²Â²Â²Â²â–Œâ–Œâ–Œâ–Œâ–Œâ–Œâ–Œâ†”â˜º It has been a while since I did anything significant in C/C++, but normally I would assume the buffer was being allocated larger than necessary, but this does not appear to be the case. fileLen ends up being 12, which is accurate. I am thinking now that I must just be displaying the buffer wrong, but I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Can anyone clue me in to what I am doing wrong?
263978 Yeah, I know the title is a mouthful... What I mean is to say is how do you communicate with a subject matter expert who needs a theory coded and tested? For example, weather simulation is a collaboration between meteorologists, computer scientists, and software engineers. The computer scientists and software engineers generally speak the same language, but he meteorologist is in a completely different world. How do you increase the level of communication and understanding between disciplines? And not necessarily just for weather, other sciences too.

I understand the concept, but building a context-free grammar for this looks like way out of my league. NOTE: I'm not taking a Compiler class in College and trying to cheat. I'm just reading the dragon book and this exercise caught my attention (and I have no idea even how to start solving it) Plus, I have no teacher to go ask... Any clues/pointers? BTW, If you have any idea on how I can prove that I'm not cheating in college, I'll gladly do it. I'm just trying to learn on my own here. Thanks

276512 I have seen some very weird for loops when reading other people's code. I have been trying to search for a full syntax explanation for the for loop in C but it is very hard because the word "for" appears in unrelated sentences making the search almost impossible to Google effectively. This question came to my mind after reading this thread which made me curious again. The for here: In the middle condition there is a comma separating the two pieces of code, what does this comma do? The comma on the right side I understand as it makes both a>>=1 and b<<=1. But within a loop exit condition, what happens? Does it exit when p==0, when a==1 or when both happen? It would be great if anyone could help me understand this and maybe point me in the direction of a full for loop syntax description.
276706 I'm someone who writes code just for fun and haven't really delved into it in either an academic or professional setting, so stuff like these bitwise operators really escapes me. I was reading an article about JavaScript, which apparently supports bitwise operations. I keep seeing this operation mentioned in places, and I've tried reading about to figure out what exactly it is, but I just don't seem to get it at all. So what are they? Clear examples would be great! :D Just a few more questions - what are some practical applications of bitwise operations? When might you use them?
279170 I'm setting up a new server, and want to support UTF-8 fully in my web application. I have tried in the past on existing servers and always seem to end up having to fall back to ISO-8859-1. Where exactly do I need to set the encoding/charsets? I'm aware that I need to configure Apache, MySQL and PHP to do this - is there some standard checklist I can follow, or perhaps troubleshoot where the mismatches occur? This is for a new Linux server, running MySQL 5, PHP 5 and Apache 2.
279534 Once a programmer decides to implement IXmlSerializable, what are the rules and best practices for implementing it? I've heard that GetSchema() should return null and ReadXml should move to the next element before returning. Are these true? And what about WriteXml: should it write a root element for the object or is it assumed that the root is already written? How should child objects be treated and written. Here's a sample of what I have now. I'll update it as I get good responses.
279966 I am building a PHP app in CodeIgniter. CI sends all requests to the main controller, /index.php. However, I don't like to see the index.php in the URL, so I've used mod_rewrite, as per the CI documentation. The rule is as follows: So for example, http://www.example.com/faq/whatever will route to http://www.example.com/index.php/faq/whatever I need a reliable way for a script to know what it's address is, so it will know what to do with the navigation. Normally, I would just check php_self, but in this case it's always index.php. I can get it from REQUEST _ URI, PATH _ INFO, etc, but trying to decide which will be most reliable. Does anyone know, or know where to find, the real difference between PHP _ SELF, PATH _ INFO, SCRIPT _ NAME, and REQUEST _ URI? (Note, I've had to add spaces, as SO sees the underscore and makes it italic for some reason) Thanks!

282267 I am thinking about adding a third monitor to my coding station. I currently run 1600x1200 on a dell 20.1", which is ok, but I am thinking to move to something that will do 1920x1200. I'm doing the purchase on eBay, so can't really see the monitor beforehand. Last time I bought a "Widescreen" (I read "ShortScreen") monitor, I hated it. In real space, I gained a couple inches width, but I lost a lot off the height. It was like getting my monitor cut in half. I'm looking at the Dell 24" or a SOYO 26". I want to make sure that the height of the screen isn't less than what I have now, in actual inches, so that the 1200 I get will be the same as the 1200 I have now, and it will just be like adding an extra 320px to the side of my existing monitor. Most of the monitors I have looked at include the HxWxD, but it's for the whole thing, including sides, stand, etc. For the life of me, I can't seem to find an actual measure of screen height and width, other than diagonal, which could be anything, depending on the diagonal angle. Does anyone have experience with the Dell 24" 248WFP or the Soyo Pearl 26", or have any idea on a resource that would show how TALL the screen is or square inches? At this point, I'd be happy if someone could just measure their screen height with a ruler for me =o) EDIT: Seriously? The guy who wrote the post about Job Hopping Etiquette: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/48618/job-hopping-etiquette felt the need to close my question because he doesn't think my monitor, on which I do all of my programming, which is the window into the world in which I work, doing my programming, is programming related? Who here thinks that your programming tools have nothing to do with programming - anyone want to try coding on the 6" monitors they have at the supermarket checkout stand?
282600 In particular, it's possible to do this knowing only the number of data points, the sum, and the sum of the squares of the datapoints. For large n (probably anything above 30), it's safe to assume, by the central limit theorem, that the distribution of the sample mean is normal (gaussian) but I'd like a procedure that gives a confidence interval for any n. My understanding is that the way to do that is to use a Student T distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. (I hate to bias answers too much, but I figure it's good for all the likely keywords to show up here.) Answers can just give an expression for delta where the confidence interval is taken to be Give delta in terms of

283888 what's the best/proper way of interacting between several windows in C# app? Recently, I've run into a problem where one of program windows has to call method modifying main window. My solution was to create factory-like class, that would arrange all underlying model-data and organize the communication between various windows (through delegates). However, as passing one or two delegates was not a problem, I started thinking what if my other windows would need 10 delegates to interact properly with main window? Are delegates good solution? How to pass them in good way - through constructor, properties? Or maybe the need of using that many delegates is some serious design flaw itself?

285015 I'm working on a linux machine through SSH (Putty). I need to leave a process running during the night, so I thought I could do that by starting the process in background (with an ampersand at the end of the command) and redirecting stdout to a file. To my surprise, that doesn't work. As soon as I close the Putty window, the process is stopped. How can I prevent that from happening??

289529 I am new to decoding techniques. Just learnt about base64, sha-1, md5 and a few others yesterday, while trying to figure out what orkut worms actually contain. I was attacked by many orkut spammers and hackers in the past few days. There is a similarity in the URLs they send to us. I don't know what information it contains but I need to figure it out. It lies in the following texts: The encoding above apparently seems to be base64 but it is not, because whenever I decode it using online base64 decoders I get raw output. It doesn't decode accurately. Maybe some other code has been mixed with base64. Can anyone please help me decode it, I'll be very grateful, thanks in advance. N-J.
290000 I'm trying to show a custom hint in a TWinControl but I can't figure out how to get it's position. Using position 0,0 shows the hint on the top of my screen (outside the window) so I guess it must be the position of the control on the screen. Edit: I've found the TControl Property ClientOrigin which returns what I've expected, is it correct to use ClientOrigin.X and ClientOrigin.Y?
291978 What exactly are the Python scoping rules? If I have some code: Where is x found? Some possible choices include the list above: Also there is the context during execution, when the function spam is passed somewhere else. And maybe lambda functions pass a bit differently? There must be a simple reference or algorithm somewhere. It's a confusing world for intermediate Python programmers.

When trying to reuse code, which uses windows.h, written for a particular compiler with another, what differences to be aware of, e.g. code written for Visual C/C++ with GCC/G++ or vice-versa? Is there any information about how to produce compatible with either one compiler or another e.g. either GC/C++ or MSVC/C++? What problems will attempting to do this cause? What about other compliers, such as LCC and Digital Mars?
295339 I have finally got the green light to use Memcached in our project (after months of lobbying against a database-based caching solution - just don't ask...), however we will need to use Repcached as well to have backup copies of our data. Has anyone built this for Win32? We may end up using Linux in production, but development will very likely be taking place on Windows. Any hints or pointers are gratefully received - there appear to be lots of .T files, which I presume is TCL? That could be fun...
296133 I'm astonished that the Apache Commons Collections project still hasn't got around to making their library generics-aware. I really like the features provided by this library, but the lack of support for generics is a big turn-off. There is a Lavalabs fork of Commons Collections which does support generics, which seems to claim backward compatability, but when I tried updating to this version, my web application failed to start (in JBoss). My questions are: BTW, I'm aware of Google collections, but can't use it, for reasons I don't quite understand. Cheers, Don
296193 I have a .NET application distributed through clickonce. Security within the application is implemented through the WindowsPrincipal.IsInRole(GroupName) method using a set of groups as resources. This structure works well for us for users within the same domain as the groups. Unfortunately we now have users that need to use the application working on machines and using user accounts in a different domain that is trusted by our domain but is not in the same forest. It seems that IsInRole() queries the AD ticket on the local machine for group membership. Unfortunately this ticket only contains domain-local groups for the domain of the machine and global and universal groups of other trusted domains, our groups are domain-local groups in the first domain. The catch-22 situation comes from the fact that AD does not allow foreign security principals in either global or universal groups and therefore while it can be queried by the users in the second domain they cannot be members of it (making it a little pointless!) To explain: There are two domains: DOM1 and DOM2 with a trust setup between them, but they are not in the same forest. DOM1\User1 DOM2\User2 are two users. I would like to put both User1 and User2 in one group that is visible to both users and can contain them both. The only way I can currently see around it is the following (where {} denotes the members of the groups, DL=Domain Local and GLO=GlobalGroup.) Make two global groups one in each domain: DOM1\GLOGroup1 : {DOM1\User1} DOM2\GLOGroup1 : {DOM2\User2} and two domain-local groups containing the two global groups: DOM1\DLGroup1 : {DOM1\GLOGroup1, DOM2\GLOGroup1} DOM2\DLGroup1 : {DOM1\GLOGroup1, DOM2\GLOGroup1} But this isn't really acceptable as we actually have more than two domains and about 70 groups to administer including a hierarchy of groups and we don't have much direct control over the administration of groups in the other domains. We haven't yet worked through any thinking on an approach using LDAP but from the little that I've read I believe it's not generally recommended for this purpose? Any help or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Many Thanks Stu

301546 There's a web services I want to call in my application, I can use it with importing the WSDL or by just use "HTTP GET" with the URL and parameters, so I prefer the later because it's simple thing. I know I can use indy idhttp.get, to do the job, but this is very simple thing and I don't want to add complex indy code to my application. UPDATE: sorry if I was not clear, I meant by "not to add complex indy code", that I don't want add indy components for just this simple task, and prefer more lighter way for that.
301924 I'm trying to test the functionality of a web app by scripting a login sequence in Python, but I'm having some troubles. Here's what I need to do: Now, I'm relatively new to python, but the two things I've tested so far haven't worked. First I used httplib, with putrequest() (passing the parameters within the URL), and putheader(). This didn't seem to follow the redirects. Then I tried urllib and urllib2, passing both headers and parameters as dicts. This seems to return the login page, instead of the page I'm trying to login to, I guess it's because of lack of cookies or something. Am I missing something simple? Thanks.
302918 Web parts seem to be used extensively in Sharepoint related development, but examples of using them in asp.net webforms applications are few and far between. I'm implementing a domain specific portal framework and like the "widgetlike" functionality in iGoogle or pageflakes and would like to get that kind of feature in my application. The real troubling issue from my perspective is that the drag & drop layout features of web parts do not work in non-IE browsers unless you use the latest ASP.NET AJAX futures library. It seems to me if Microsoft meant this to be a foundation technology, they would have moved these features into the main product by now. Are web parts a dead-end technology? If so, are there any alternatives?

312443 I have a list of arbitrary length, and I need to split it up into equal size chunks and operate on it. There are some obvious ways to do this, like keeping a counter and two lists, and when the second list fills up, add it to the first list and empty the second list for the next round of data, but this is potentially extremely expensive. I was wondering if anyone had a good solution to this for lists of any length, e.g. using generators. I was looking for something useful in itertools but I couldn't find anything obviously useful. Might've missed it, though. Related question: What is the most â€œpythonicâ€? way to iterate over a list in chunks?

So essentially each "bug watch" will be a bug ID that will be passed to a sub routine along with the "sleep" time, and once the the "sleep time" is over it must recur without blocking the parent process or the peer processes. I tried Schedule::Cron It supports cron like format but here the arguments to the subs must be simple scalars hence I ruled it out. POE/Coro seem to be another options but I don't have much idea about it/ :( Any insights ? TIA -Matt.

315911 Ok, after seeing this post by PJ Hyett, I have decided to skip to the end and go with git. So what I need is a beginners practical guide to git. "Beginner" being defined as someone who knows how to handle their compiler, understands to some level what a makefile is, and has touched source control without understanding it very well. "Practical" being defined as this person doesn't want to get into great detail regarding what git is doing in the background, and doesn't even care (or know) that it's distributed. Your answers might hint at the possibilities, but try to aim for the beginner that wants to keep a 'main' repository on a 'server' which is backed up and secure, and treat their local repository as merely a 'client' resource. Procedural note: PLEASE pick one and only one of the below topics and answer it clearly and concisely in any given answer. Don't try to jam a bunch of information into one answer. Don't just link to other resources - cut and paste with attribution if copyright allows, otherwise learn it and explain it in your own words (ie, don't make people leave this page to learn a task). Please comment on, or edit, an already existing answer unless your explanation is very different and you think the community is better served with a different explanation rather than altering the existing explanation. So: I will go through the entries from time to time and 'tidy' them up so they have a consistent look/feel and it's easy to scan the list - feel free to follow a simple "header - brief explanation - list of instructions - gotchas and extra info" template. I'll also link to the entries from the bullet list above so it's easy to find them later.

317678 Sometimes, while I am debugging a c# application, I will hit a break point and when I try to continue, step or step into, it just does nothing. The yellow line highlighting the current line goes away, but it never reaches the next line. The app is still frozen like I am on a breakpoint and I can do nothing but hit the stop debugging button and restart. This doesn't happen all the time, but once it starts on an app it seems like it always happens after that for that app. I have found that adding the following code just before the class declaration "fixes" the problem for that app, but am very curious as to why this is happening. Additional details: I have not noticed any kind of pattern as to what the particular line does when it freezes. Most of the apps I write use threading, so there is a decent chance this is happening within a thread every time.
319506 I've be working with a Java application run through the command-line. It deals with XML files, specially the dblp.xml database which has more than 400MB. I was using JVM 5 and my app needed sort of 600-700MB of memory to processe the dblp.xml. After updating to JVM 6, it starting needing more than 1gb of memory (something I don't have), although it runs a bit faster. I'm preety sure of the memory consumption difference, because I've already tested both again and again in this same computer. Resulting in the same difference of memory consumption. I didn't set any special parameters, just -Xmx800M or -Xmx1000M. Running with Ubuntu Hardy Heron on a dual core 1.7ghz, with 1,5gb of memory Using only the top/ps commands to measure Any one have an idea why this occurs? I really wanted to use JVM 6, because in my production server it is the JVM in use, and I'm not quite able to change easily. Thanks

319894 Many of our customers have access to InstallShield, WISE or AdminStudio. These aren't a problem. I'm hoping there is some way I can provide our smaller customers without access to commercial repackaging tools a freely available set of tools and steps to do the file replacement themselves. Only need to replace a single configuration file inside a compressed MSI, the target user can be assumed to already have Orca installed, know how to use this to customize the Property table (to embed license details for GPO deployment) and have generated an MST file. The file that needs to be replaced is less than 1kb. So if rather than creating a CAB file I can leave it externally in the same folder as the MSI, or stream it directly into the binary table using Orca then that would be great! = One less step for the customer ;) EDIT: suggestions below don't quite work, when adding a medium with no cabinet file I get "Error 2920. Source directory not specified for file " However it does work if I use a cabinet file. Suggestions? Disclaimer: this is very similar to another question but both questions and answers in that thread are not clear.
320366 We are developing a number of games on multiple paltforms (DS/Wii/Xbox 360/PS3/PC/PSP). Each has their own compiler/linker and debugger. We want to use Visual Studio as the IDE and to manage the build process but use the platform specific compilers (and settings) to generate the appropriate output. We could manage the build process outside of VS (using jam or ant say) but this is not the preffered solution. Trawling the web, this seems to be a common problem but no-one has a good solution. Has anyone solved this problem? What's the best way of handling this. A number of solutions spring to mind - auto-generate nant scripts from the solition in a pre-build step (probably the least work but still not ideal), replace cl.exe and link.exe with stub apps, use msbuild (but this is geared towards .net development and not native code), write a custom VS plug-in (lots of work - any pointers to an existing one either commercial or open soruce would be good). Anyone tried any of these? Was it good for you? ;) Cheers

326937 I have been using TortoiseSVN, svn, and subclipse and I think I understand the basics, but there's one thing that's been bugging me for a while: Merging introduces unwanted code. Here's the steps. trunk/test.txt@r2. A test file was created with 'A' and a return: branches/TRY-XX-Foo/test.txt@r3. Branched out the trunk to TRY-XX-Foo: branches/TRY-XX-Foo/test.txt@r4. Made an unwanted change in TRY-XX-Foo and committed it: branches/TRY-XX-Foo/test.txt@r5. Made an important bug fix in TRY-XX-Foo and committed it: Now, I would like to merge only the important bug fix back to trunk. So, I run merge for revision 4:5. What I end up in my working directory is a conflict. trunk/test.txt: Against my will, Subversion has now included "unwanted change" into the trunk code, and I need to weed them out manually. Is there a way to merge only specified revisions when multiple consecutive changes are made in the branch? The part of the problem is that B (unwated change) is included in .merge-right and I can't tell the difference between which revision it came from.

334729 We have a .NET object that does a lot of reading/writing with the database. Throughout the life cycle of this object (or the asp page that uses it), it may hit the database with a query/update anywhere from 1 to 10 times. Instead of opening and closing a database connection every time the object needs to hit the database, it simply opens a connection to the database during instantiation and then closes the connection during the object's termination event. Is that a bad practice? The assumption was that since the object hits the database every time it's instantiated (and usually multiple times), it would be better to just open a connection at the beginning of the object's life and then close it at the end. The other alternative is to open and close the database connection before and after each query/operation. What's the best practice here in order to maximize performance? update Thanks for the tips guys. Can anyone speak more to the method of opening/closing a connection inside an object's instantiation/termination events and the repercussions of doing so?

335525 I have an application in which I have to store a couple of millions of integers, I have to store them in a Look up table, obviously I cannot store such amount of data in memory and in my requirements I am very limited I have to store the data in an embebedded system so I am very limited in the space, so I would like to ask you about recommended methods that I can use for the reduction of the look up table. I cannot use function approximation such as neural networks, the values needs to be in a table. The range of the integers is not known at the moment. When I say integers I mean a 32 bit value. Clearly I cannot store the real value of the integers and I need some type of approximation, I found one called tile coding http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/8/node6.html, this one is based on several look up tables, does anyone know any other method?.

339180 I run all my integers through a (int)Integer to make them safe to use in my query strings. I also run my strings through this function code I obviously return the $cleanedString variable.

Are there any other special characters for mySQL I should be concerned about? On a second note, is there anything wrong or redundant about my search and replace after the mysql_real_escape_string? I got it from a website when I was first starting out and (if I remember correctly) it said you had to use this search/replace in addition to the escape string. It looks like it's trying to remove any previously escaped injection characters?

343654 I am looking to refactor a c# method into a c function in an attempt to gain some speed, and then call the c dll in c# to allow my program to use the functionality. Currently the c# method takes a list of integers and returns a list of lists of integers. The method calculated the power set of the integers so an input of 3 ints would produce the following output (at this stage the values of the ints is not important as it is used as an internal weighting value) Where each line represents a list of integers. The output indicates the index (with an offset of 1) of the first list, not the value. So 1,2 indicates that the element at index 0 and 1 are an element of the power set. I am unfamiliar with c, so what are my best options for data structures that will allow the c# to access the returned data? Thanks in advance Update Thank you all for your comments so far. Here is a bit of a background to the nature of the problem. The iterative method for calculating the power set of a set is fairly straight forward. Two loops and a bit of bit manipulation is all there is to it really. It just get called..a lot (in fact billions of times if the size of the set is big enough). My thoughs around using c (c++ as people have pointed out) are that it gives more scope for performance tuning. A direct port may not offer any increase, but it opens the way for more involved methods to get a bit more speed out of it. Even a small increase per iteration would equate to a measurable increase. My idea was to port a direct version and then work to increase it. And then refactor it over time (with help from everyone here at SO). Update 2 Another fair point from jalf, I dont have to use list or equivelent. If there is a better way then I am open to suggestions. The only reason for the list was that each set of results is not the same size.

348363 I'm writing an application that allows users to upload images onto the server. I expect about 20 images per day all jpeg and probably not edited/resized. (This is another question, how to resize the images on the server side before storing. Maybe someone can please drop a .NET resource for that in the comment or so). I wonder now what the best practice for storing uploaded images is. Is it a) I store the images as a file in the file system and create a record in a table with the exact path to that image. or b) I store the image itself in a table using an "image" or "binary data" data type of the database server. I see advantages and disadvantages in both. I like a) because I can easily relocate the files and just have to change the table entry. On the other hand I don't like storing business data on the web server and I don't really want to connect the web server to any other datasource that holds business data (for security reasons) I like b) because all the information is in one place and easily accessible by a query. On the other hand the database will get very big very soon. Outsourcing that data could be more difficult. Cheers, Tobias
349094 I've been having an agruement with a friend that Mason (Perl) is not a framework, but a templating language. I feel Mason for Perl does what JSP does for Java (as an analogy, not pure technical comparison). From what I know, JSP is not a framework and I feel neither is Mason. When I looked up wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_(Perl)], I see that the main site says it is a web application framework written in Perl while the discussion page contests it. Any pointers on why it is/ it is not a framework? Update based on comments from ysth: For a framework, I feel it should at least make db access easy, manage sessions, basic security that a webapp would need, templating and code reuse (or libraries that make basic tasks easy).

351470 I'm in the process of extending and improving a website that has quite a few structural problems. It looks very much like the developers before me had heard of MVC but didn't understand the ideas of abstraction or modularity. So the MVC "framework" is a) bespoke b) broken c) patched and d) there are several in use all at once. I intend to fix that. This is not the first time I've re-built a site's framework, BTW, but it is the first time I've had to fix an MVC framework. However, I'm coming up against some missing holes in the MVC knowledge here on SO. The first is how closely programmers seem to tie their SQL database with their models. This doesn't make sense to me: do programmers normally have the model looking after the data abstraction? (To me this is little better than putting SQL in raw PHP code.) Or is there a data access layer normally employed that "Does SQL"? I know from experience that the latter means the calling code doesn't have to worry about where the data is, or how to get it or how to write it: the API handles that. But what about the Models? Are they intended to be re-usable amongst different pages? Should they care about just where the data is stored? Shouldn't they be more concerned with handling the logic between data-fetch and data-show (e.g. turning a contact's group ID into a displayable name)? And data-save and data-write (e.g. figuring out how to turn $_POST values into savable data)? Maybe the MVC model really be DMVC - Data-Model-View-Controller. Lastly, although this is from a PHP point-of-view, how well do these concepts translate to a JSP site?
351615 What are the things that should be considered when defining indexes, clustered and non-clustered, for SQL Server? Are there any anti-patterns that DB newbies should be aware of? Please explain the "Why" or provide references if possible.
352335 I am using an open source client to programmatically process incoming emails (on Windows 2003). The only way to prevent receiving previously read emails is to delete them from the server. This is less than ideal. As far as I know, there is no command in Pop3 to set emails as being read. So how do you go about this?
353497 So like many people, I'm excited about Ruby on Rails. Being a Windows user, I downloaded InstantRails, got it going, and followed along with the screencast on how to make a blog with RoR 2.0 in fifteen minutes. I used Notepad++ as my text editor, because that's what I've traditionally used for writing the PHP-based websites I've done in the past. I was a little envious of Mac users and how they get the really attractive-looking TextMate, but I managed to follow through the entire screencast and get everything working smoothly. However, I was lost most of the time. I know plenty of programming and scripting languages over the years - C++, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, and Lua just to name a few. I don't know Ruby, but I understand a lot of how it works, as far as the syntax is concerned, but I don't understand a lot of the logic behind why certain files do certain things, and that sort of thing. Also, I tried Aptana with RadRails, but found it difficult to set up. Is there any concrete tutorial for getting it set up and working fully with Ruby on Rails 2.0? Should I maybe just wait for more RoR 2.0 tutorials to come out before attempting to learn RoR? Or should I just plow on through and experiment until I figure it out? EDIT: Editing solely to get the badge. >_>
354488 Like most developers I have grown to love dual monitors. I won't go into all the reasons for their goodness; just take it as a given. However, they are not perfect. You can never seem to line them up "just right". You always end up with the monitors at slight funny angles. And of course the bezel always gets in the way. And this is with identical monitors. The problem is much worse with different monitors -- VMWare's multi monitor feature won't even work with monitors of differnt resolutions. When you use multiple monnitors, one of them becomes your primary monitor of focus. Your focus may flip from one monitor to the other, but at any point in time you are usually focusing on only one monitor. There are exceptions to this (WinDiff, Excel), but this is generally the case. I suggest that having a single large monitor with all the benefits of multiple smaller monitors would be a better solution. Wide screen monitors are fantastic, but it is hard to use all the space efficiently. If you are writing code you are generally working on the left-hand side of the window. If you maximize an editor on a wide-screen monitor the right-hand side of the window will be a sea of white. Programs like WinSplit Revolution will help to organise your windows, but this is really just addressing the symptom, not the problem. Even with WinSplit Revolution, when you maximise a window it will take up the whole screen. You can't lock a window into a specific section of the screen. This is where virtual monitors comes in. What would be really nice is a video driver that sits on top of the existing driver, but allows a single monitor to be virtualised into multiple monitors. Control Panel would see your single physical monitor as two or more virtual monitors. The software could even support a virtual bezel to emphasise what is happening, or you could opt for seamless mode. Programs like WinSplit Revolution and UltraMon would still work. This virtual video driver would allow you to slice & dice your physical monitor into as many virtual monitors as you want. Does anybody know if such software exists? If not, are there any budding Windows display driver guru's out there willing to take up the challenge? I am not after the myriad of virtual desktop/window manager programs that are available. I get frustrated with these programs. They seem good at first but they usually have some strange behaviour and don't work well with other programs (such as WinSplit Revolution). I want the real thing!
355813 I've got some entities which have decimal properties on them. These entities' properties are displayed in multiple places throughout my UI. Currently I'm finding myself doing: all over the place. Now I know for a fact that in several instances, and am suspicious of many others that the client is likely to want the values to 3d.p. in the future. Is there some pattern I can employ to handle the formatting of this Weight property (and other properties; not just decimals, perhaps dates etc.) so that I can have this formatting in a single place? I know could use a formatstring in the webconfig, or write some extension methods in the UI but these don't seem very elegant solutions. It would be nice to have some formatting objects which are tied to my entities, so its inherently obvious which formatter to use. Thanks, Andrew
355945 Is there a quick and nice way with lambda expressions?
356371 I was wondering what I could do to improve the performance of Excel automation, as it can be quite slow if you have a lot going on in the worksheet... Here's a few I found myself: ExcelApp.ScreenUpdating = false -- turn of the redrawing of the screen ExcelApp.Calculation = Excel.XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual -- turning of the calculation engine so Excel doesn't autotomatically recalculates when a cell value changes (turn it back on after you're done) Reduce calls to Worksheet.Cells.Item(row, col) and Worksheet.Range -- I had to poll hundreds of cells to find the cell I needed. Implementing some caching of cell locations, reduced the execution time from ~40 to ~5 seconds. What kind of interop calls take a heavy toll on performance and should be avoided? What else can you do to avoid unnecessary processing being done?
357364 Is a string actually a character array (is-a), or does it have a character array as an internal store (has-a), or is it's own object which can expose itself as a with an array of characters? I am more inclided to say it is it's own object, but then why are we so inclined to always say "A string is an array of characters..."?
358964 Someone on here recently recommended BWToolkit, and it really impressed me, so I started googling for more IB plug-ins. I've found a couple on random blogs, but haven't been able to find any kind of repository/aggregator for them. Anyone know where I can find more of these? Thanks.
359438 Does anyone know of any optimization packages out there for R (similar to NUOPT for S+) Thanks
359494 I'm using JSLint to go through JavaScript, and it's returning many suggestions to replace == (two equals signs) with === (three equals signs) when doing things like comparing idSele_UNVEHtype.value.length == 0 inside of an if statement. Is there a performance benefit to replacing == with ===? Any performance improvement would be welcomed as many comparison operators exist. If no type conversion takes place, would there be a performance gain over ==?
376551 I'm trying to checkout a repository via command line (the 'svn co' command), using the svn+ssh protocol. I need to checkout as a different user than what I currently am. The command svn co svn+ssh://username@server/repo/ would make sense, however when it prompts for a password, it never accepts it. How do I checkout a repository over svn+ssh with a different user? Edit to clarify a concern that this is off topic: I'm trying to create a script to update a website to the current version. This is where the script fails.
377631 . That's just wrong... Either it should fail or it should parse correctly. Do you know any robust natural language date/time parser in php? How do you parse natural language date time in php? Edit 0: Thanks a lot for your comments. I perhaps need to clarify the word "wrong" here. I wouldn't so much mind if strtotime always tried do a fuzzy match. But that it doesn't - "16 Dec, 2010" is either a valid GNU date input format or it is not. In the first case it should return the correct answer and in the second it should return a false as it usually does when fed garbage. This is why I call it's current behaviour wrong.
378880 I have only code.
380198 Is it possible to pass a function as a parameter in C#? I can do it using the Func or Action classes, but this forces me to declare the entire function signature at once. When I try to use Delegate, I get a compile error saying it can't convert a method group to a Delegate. The use case is that I want to call MethodBase.Invoke on it, which doesn't require the parameter and return types to be known at compile time.
381157 I got help building this regular expression yesterday, but I don't fully understand it. It takes a name like Parisi, Kenneth and prints out kparisi Knowns: s/ = substitute m/ = match I tried searching for the rest but couldn't find anything that really helped explain it. I also didn't understand how the =~ is supposed to evaluate to either true or false, yet in this situation, it is modifying the string.
381171 I usually do not have difficulty to read Javascript script but this one I can't figure out the logic. The code is from an Exploit that has been published 4 days ago. You can find it at [milw0rm][1]. Here is the code : Here is what I believe it does and I would like you to help me for the part that I misunderstand. The variable shellcode contain the code to open the calc.exe I do not get it how they have found that weird string... any idea? The second thing is the variable spray. I do not understand this weird loop? The third thing is the variable memory that is never used anywhere, why do they create it? Last thing, What does the XML tag in the page?

381542 As Joel points out in Stack Overflow podcast #34, in C Programming Language (aka: K & R), there is mention of this property of arrays in C: a[5] == 5[a] Joel says that it's because of pointer arithmetic but I still don't understand. Why does a[5] == 5[a] ? Edit: The accepted answer is great. For a lower level view of how this works, see the comments section on that answer. There's a phenomenal conversation there about it. (This edit written about the comments available at the time. ie: the first ~16)
381545 I have a SSRS report and using PL/SQL for the dataset creation. My report needs two tables 1 one gives detailed view.(dataset 1) 2 one below that gives a summary table (data should come from the calculations based on the data in 1 table) I am using a temporary table for the dataset one. What are the methods to get calculated result for dataset 2. I wrote 2 procedures for each. since first table is a temporary one i am not getting result for second dataset. Why can be the options. Can I have multiple dataset out of single procedure?
383728 Well, I have this bit of code that is slowing down the program hugely because it is linear complexity but called a lot of times making the program quadratic complexity. If possible I would like to reduce its computational complexity but otherwise I'll just optimize it where I can. So far I have reduced down to: Anyone see anything I've missed? Thanks! EDIT: I forgot to mention: n is always a prime number. EDIT 2: Here is my new improved program (thank's for all the contributions!): EDIT 3: And testing it out in its real context it is much faster! Well this question appears solved but there are many useful answers. I should also say that as well as those above optimizations, I have memoized the function using Python dictionaries...
383947 I have seen this mentioned a few times and I am not totally clear on what it means. When and why would you do this? I know what interfaces do, but the fact I am not clear on this makes me think I am missing out on using them correctly. Is it just so if you were to do: You could use any class that implements IInterface? When would you need to do that? The only thing I can think of is if you have a method and you are unsure of what object will be passed expect for it implementing IInterface. I cannot think how often you would need to do that... (Also, how could you write a method that takes in a object that implements an interface? Is that possible?) Sorry if I completely missed the point.
384042 Is there a built in way to limit the depth of a System.Collection.Generics.Stack? So that if you are at max capacity, pushing a new element would remove the bottom of the stack? I know I can do it by converting to an array and rebuilding the stack, but I figured there's probably a method on it already. EDIT: I wrote an extension method: So, it returns a new stack upon trimming, but isn't immutability the functional way =) The reason for this is that I'm storing undo steps for an app in a stack, and I only want to store a finite amount of steps.
384502 Not to long ago, someone told me that long are not 64 bits on 64 bit machines and I should always use int. This did not make sense to me. I have seen docs (such as the one on Apple's official site) say that long are indeed 64 bits when compiling for a 64-bit CPU. I looked up what it was on 64-bit Windows and found (from http://www.intel.com/cd/ids/developer/asmo-na/eng/197664.htm?page=2) What should I use? Should I define something like uw, sw ((un)signed width) as a long if not on Windows, and otherwise do a check on the target CPU bitsize?
385095 I have a samba network share on a FreeBSD box that I use for development. I have it set up as a shared drive on my WinXP box, and it works fine. However, if I reboot the xp box, the shared drive will not be accessible until I click on it and enter the password, even though I have set it to use the correct username and password and to connect at startup. Does anyone know offhand what might be the issue? I can get version data, etc. if necessary, but wanted to hang this out there briefly to see if it might be a common samba issue. Thanks! EDIT: So Sorry! I thought I had said I have XP Pro. I actually have the auth stored in the mapped drive, where it says "authenticate using user." I also use the same username for the samba share as the xp login, though not the same pw.
385298 For those who are wondering why is this overload being done on the first place please check C++ I'm stuck filling this BST with its proper values I need two search functions to be able to properly fill in the words of the dictionary and later define its synonyms/antonyms.
385367 Is there any Standard for F5 and Ctrl+F5 action in browser? I once did experiment in IE6 and Firefox 2.x. The "F5" will trigger HTTP request sent to server end with "If-Modified-Since" header, while "Ctrl+F5" doesn't have such header. In my understanding, F5 will try to utilize cached content as much as possible; and "Ctrl+F" is intended to abandon all cached content and just retrieve content from servers again. I once wrote about it in my blog (which is in Chinese, because I am a Chinese). Today, I suddenly found that in latest browser such as Chrome, IE8. It doesn't work in this way any more. Both "F5" and "Ctrl + F5" send "If-Modified-Since" header. I'm wondering whether there is some "standard" behaviors for "F5" and "Ctrl+F5" in browser. Update: Thanks to this link. It turns out that IE7/IE8 behaves like this because the focus is not inside web page. However, it seems that Chrome doesn't define "Ctrl + F5". So, its "Ctrl+F5" behaves exactly as "F5" does.
386697 ###Duplicate of: Continuous Integration Servers Hi, Recently i've looked into several CIS and read a lot of articles about them. I'm kinda impressed by Hudson, because it is so easy to set up. I like to start a discussion about several CIS like CC, Bamboo, Continuum etc. It would be nice if some experienced users could tell me about difficulties of some CIS or positive things. I for example had no problems setting up Hudson. Cruise Control seemd kinda messy but still i got it working too. I had more problems when i tried to build a project with bamboo or continuum. Of course i just scratched on the surface of each of those systems so i hope i get some useful informations. thanks kukudas
388242 This question attempts to collect the few pearls among the dozens of bad C++ books that are published every year. Unlike many other programming languages, which are often picked up on the go from tutorials found on the Internet, few are able to quickly pick up C++ without studying a well-written C++ book. It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that there are very many very bad C++ books out there. And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting glaringly obvious factual errors and promoting abysmally bad programming styles. And it's even worse with online tutorials. (There is a reason nobody bothered to setup a similar question for online tutorials.) Please provide quality books and an approximate skill level â€” preferably after discussing your addition in the C++ chat room. (The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from. Feel free to debate quality, headings, etc. Books that meet the criteria will be added to the list. Books that have reviews by the Association of C and C++ Users (ACCU) have links to the review. To spell it out bluntly: There is no need to add a 75th answer to this question. If you feel like a book should be added, suggest it to the community and let's discuss it. Note: FAQs and other resources can be found in the C++ tag info and under c++-faq. There is also a similar post for C: The Definitive C Book Guide and List A Tour of C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup) The "tour" is a quick (about 180 pages and 14 chapters) tutorial overview of all of standard C++ (language and standard library, and using C++11) at a moderately high level for people who already know C++ or at least are experienced programmers. This book is an extended version of the material that constitutes Chapters 2-5 of The C++ Programming Language, 4th edition. The C++ Programming Language (Bjarne Stroustrup) (updated for C++11) The classic introduction to C++ by its creator. Written to parallel the classic K&R, this indeed reads very much alike it and covers just about everything from the core language to the standard library, to programming paradigms to the language's philosophy. (Thereby making the latest editions break the 1k page barrier.) [Review] The fourth edition (released on May 19, 2013) covers C++11. C++ Standard Library Tutorial and Reference (Nicolai Josuttis) (updated for C++11) The introduction and reference for the C++ Standard Library. The second edition (released on April 9, 2012) covers C++11. [Review] The C++ IO Streams and Locales (Angelika Langer and Klaus Kreft) There's very little to say about this book except that, if you want to know anything about streams and locales, then this is the one place to find definitive answers. [Review] C++11 References: The C++ Standard (INCITS/ISO/IEC 14882-2011) This, of course, is the final arbiter of all that is or isn't C++. Be aware, however, that it is intended purely as a reference for experienced users willing to devote considerable time and effort to its understanding. As usual, the first release was quite expensive ($300+ US), but it has now been released in electronic form for $60US Overview of the New C++ (C++11/14) (PDF only) (Scott Meyers) (updated for C++1y/C++14) These are the presentation materials (slides and some lecture notes) of a three-day training course offered by Scott Meyers, who's a highly respected author on C++. Even though the list of items is short, the quality is high. If you are new to programming or if you have experience in other languages and are new to C++, these books are highly recommended. C++ Primer * (Stanley Lippman, JosÃ©e Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo) (updated for C++11) Coming at 1k pages, this is a very thorough introduction into C++ that covers just about everything in the language in a very accessible format and in great detail. The fifth edition (released August 16, 2012) covers C++11. [Review] Accelerated C++ (Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo) This basically covers the same ground as the C++ Primer, but does so on a fourth of its space. This is largely because it does not attempt to be an introduction to programming, but an introduction to C++ for people who've previously programmed in some other language. It has a steeper learning curve, but, for those who can cope with this, it is a very compact introduction into the language. (Historically, it broke new ground by being the first beginner's book using a modern approach at teaching the language.) [Review] Thinking in C++ (Bruce Eckel) Two volumes; second is more about standard library, but still very good Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup) An introduction to programming using C++ by the creator of the language. A good read, that assumes no previous programming experience, but is not only for beginners. (The 2nd Edition (updated for C++11) is coming.) Effective C++ (Scott Meyers) This was written with the aim of being the best second book C++ programmers should read, and it succeeded. Earlier editions were aimed at programmers coming from C, the third edition changes this and targets programmers coming from languages like Java. It presents ~50 easy-to-remember rules of thumb along with their rationale in a very accessible (and enjoyable) style. [Review] Effective STL (Scott Meyers) This aims to do the same to the part of the standard library coming from the STL what Effective C++ did to the language as a whole: It presents rules of thumb along with their rationale. [Review] More Effective C++ (Scott Meyers) Even more rules of thumb than Effective C++. Not as important as the ones in the first book, but still good to know. Exceptional C++ (Herb Sutter) Presented as a set of puzzles, this has one of the best and thorough discussions of the proper resource management and exception safety in C++ through Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII) in addition to in-depth coverage of a variety of other topics including the pimpl idiom, name lookup, good class design, and the C++ memory model. [Review] More Exceptional C++ (Herb Sutter) Covers additional exception safety topics not covered in Exceptional C++, in addition to discussion of effective object oriented programming in C++ and correct use of the STL. [Review] Exceptional C++ Style (Herb Sutter) Discusses generic programming, optimization, and resource management; this book also has an excellent exposition of how to write modular code in C++ by using nonmember functions and the single responsibility principle. [Review] C++ Coding Standards (Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu) "Coding standards" here doesn't mean "how many spaces should I indent my code?" This book contains 101 best practices, idioms, and common pitfalls that can help you to write correct, understandable, and efficient C++ code. [Review] C++ Templates: The Complete Guide (David Vandevoorde and Nicolai M. Josuttis) This is the book about templates as they existed before C++11. It covers everything from the very basics to some of the most advanced template metaprogramming and explains every detail of how templates work (both conceptually and at how they are implemented) and discusses many common pitfalls. Has excellent summaries of the One Definition Rule (ODR) and overload resolution in the appendices. [Review] Modern C++ Design (Andrei Alexandrescu) A groundbreaking book on advanced generic programming techniques. Introduces policy-based design, type lists, and fundamental generic programming idioms then explains how many useful design patterns (including small object allocators, functors, factories, visitors, and multimethods) can be implemented efficiently, modularly, and cleanly using generic programming. [Review] C++ Template Metaprogramming (David Abrahams and Aleksey Gurtovoy) C++ Concurrency In Action (Anthony Williams) A book covering C++11 concurrency support including the thread library, the atomics library, the C++ memory model, locks and mutexes, as well as issues of designing and debugging multithreaded applications. Advanced C++ Metaprogramming (Davide Di Gennaro) A pre-C++11 manual of TMP techniques, focused more on practice than theory. There are a ton of snippets in this book, some of which are made obsolete by typetraits, but the techniques, are nonetheless, useful to know. If you can put up with the quirky formatting/editing, it is easier to read than Alexandrescu, and arguably, more rewarding. For more experienced developers, there is a good chance that you may pick up something about a dark corner of C++ (a quirk) that usually only comes about through extensive experience. Note: Some information contained within these books may not be up-to-date or no longer considered best practice. The Design and Evolution of C++ (Bjarne Stroustrup) If you want to know why the language is the way it is, this book is where you find answers. This covers everything before the standardization of C++. Ruminations on C++ - (Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo) [Review] Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms (James Coplien) A predecessor of the pattern movement, it describes many C++-specific "idioms". It's certainly a very good book and still worth a read if you can spare the time, but quite old and not up-to-date with current C++. Large Scale C++ Software Design (John Lakos) Lakos explains techniques to manage very big C++ software projects. Certainly a good read, if it only was up to date. It was written long before C++98, and misses on many features (e.g. namespaces) important for large scale projects. If you need to work in a big C++ software project, you might want to read it, although you need to take more than a grain of salt with it. There's been the rumor that Lakos is writing an up-to-date edition of the book for years. Inside the C++ Object Model (Stanley Lippman) If you want to know how virtual member functions are commonly implemented and how base objects are commonly laid out in memory in a multi-inheritance scenario, and how all this affects performance, this is where you will find thorough discussions of such topics. This question has historical significance, but is not a good example of an appropriate question. Read and learn from this post, but please do not use it as evidence that you can ask similar questions. See the FAQ for more information.
438029 I asked this question: Serial Port (rs232) in Mono for multiple platforms and this one is related: How do I get the friendly name of a COM port in Windows? But I want to be able to get the "friendly" name on Windows- and possibly also on linux /mac if there is such a thing. Is there any cross platform way to do it, or am I out of luck? Here is what I am doing in my current app - and it works great for native C++ win32. http://www.naughter.com/enumser.html In any case it does not look like a pretty solution for cross-platform distribution. Does anyone have any suggestions? EDIT - since people are having trouble understanding what I am asking for: as an example - COM9 is not a friendly name. I want something that says "COM9 - USB connector" or something like that. This is possible with the link above in Win32. It is nasty and hacky, but many times end users have no idea what COM port they need to open in my program unless there is a useful name - more useful than "COMn."
438347 I've been working on a DirectX application in C#, and I noticed that when I lock the workstation, the DirectX "Device" becomes lost. After looking up the information about what to do upon when a device is lost (and when a DeviceLostException is thrown by Device.Present), I re-wrote the code reset the Device. This simply meant that I made a call to Device.Reset. Calling Device.Reset recovered the Device. No problem. But when I lost the device a second time (for example, when the computer was locked, went to sleep, or activated a screen-saver), an exception was thrown by Device.Reset. The exception was InvalidCallException, which (according to the documentation) means something went wrong with the call. So I assumed it was a problem with the arguments to the function. So instead of passing the same copy of PresentParams that I used to create the Device, I created a new instance of PresentParams (at first using the copy constructor, and later by re-creating without it) and passed that to Device.Reset. Doesn't work. Device.Reset still dies with the InvalidCallException. Oh, and the message of the exception? "Error in application." Not helpful. Can you point me in the direction of either a solution, or some documentation about how to get more debug information out of DirectX?
439322 Newbie here, in C# what is the difference between the upper and lower case String/string? Thanks
440474 I have multiple tables with an "id" component. I'd like to use LINQ to get an item from one of these tables with the correct LINQ-To-SQL type, but only using one CompiledQuery. Here's an example that works currently. Say the object type defined in the DBML is "myitem" and its table is "myitems". I'd like to make this, where the type can be "myitem", "myitems2", or whatever table and object type I might be interested in. I made up this syntax because I'm not sure what the syntax should look like here. Any ideas if it's possible? Would I have to munge the DBML to make some kind of superclass for the types involved? Thank you.
441248 The company I work at is run on Excel sheets. Several of those sheets have some form of VBA code embedded. I'm doing some maintenance on them, but it feels really dated. What's gonna happen to Office VBA? Why hasn't Microsoft released an embedded .NET macro language for Office?
441264 What is the class hierarchy that is most necessary to get a excellent grasp of, for the aspiring C# desktop applications programmer? Not just the totally obvious stuff. EDIT: To clarify, I mean, that as I am learning C#, I would like to know what are the classes I should be acquainting myself with, that aren't necessarily going to be obvious to someone who isn't experienced enough to know what is, and is not important to learn. EDIT2: Are there any more obscure classes? So far I know a good deal about many of these already given.

441684 What major features are missing from Linq-to-Sql? I have already developed a major project with Linq-to-Sql at it's DAL Heart. i hadn't developed using a relational data mapper before, so it was a learning curve coming from datasets. But i didn't find any major problems which couldn't be solved with Linq-to-Sql. My testing concluded that it was significantly faster than Linq-to-Entities. So what major features are missing from Linq-to-Sql? I guess what i am trying to ask is if development on Linq-to-Sql is ceased - will it matter?

33 Math.Floor rounds down, Math.Ceiling rounds up, and Math.Truncate rounds towards zero. Thus, Math.Truncate is like Math.Floor for positive numbers, and like Math.Ceiling for negative numbers. Here's the reference. For completeness, Math.Round rounds to the nearest integer. If the number is exactly midway between two integers, then it rounds towards the even one. Reference. See also: Pax Diablo's answer. Highly recommended!
396 Use email authentication methods, such as SPF, and DKIM to prove that your emails and your domain name belong together, and to prevent spoofing of your domain name. The SPF website includes a wizard to generate the DNS information for your site. Check your reverse DNS to make sure the IP address of your mail server points to the domain name that you use for sending mail. Make sure that the IP-address that you're using is not on a blacklist Make sure that the reply-to address is a valid, existing address. Use the full, real name of the addressee in the To field, not just the email-address (e.g. "John Smith" <john@blacksmiths-international.com> ). Monitor your abuse accounts, such as abuse@yourdomain.com and postmaster@yourdomain.com. That means - make sure that these accounts exist, read what's sent to them, and act on complaints. Finally, make it really easy to unsubscribe. Otherwise, your users will unsubscribe by pressing the spam button, and that will affect your reputation. That said, getting Hotmail to accept your emails remains a black art.
451 Yahoo uses a method called Sender ID, which can be configured at The SPF Setup Wizard and entered in to your DNS. Also one of the important ones for Exchange, Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, and others is to have a Reverse DNS for your domain. Those will knock out most of the issues. However you can never prevent a person intentionally blocking your or custom rules.
629 I found this page which shows what the difference between Proc.new and lambda are. According to the page, the only difference is that a lambda is strict about the number of arguments it accepts, whereas Proc.new converts missing arguments to nil. Here is an example IRB session illustrating the difference: The page also recommends using lambda unless you specifically want the error tolerant behavior. I agree with this sentiment. Using a lambda seems a tad more concise, and with such an insignificant difference, it seems the better choice in the average situation. As for Ruby 1.9, sorry, I haven't looked into 1.9 yet, but I don't imagine they would change it all that much (don't take my word for it though, it seems you have heard of some changes, so I am probably wrong there).
755 The Activator class within the root System namespace is pretty powerful. There are a lot of overloads for passing parameters to the constructor and such. Check out the documentation at: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.activator.createinstance.aspx Here are some simple examples:
906 I worked on a project for my previous employer that used .NET, and there was a built in .resx format we used. We basically had a file that had all translations in the .resx file, and then multiple files with different translations. The consequence of this is that you have to be very diligent about ensuring that all strings visible in the application are stored in the .resx, and anytime one is changed you have to update all languages you support. If you get lazy and don't notify the people in charge of translations, or you embed strings without going through your localization system, it will be a nightmare to try and fix it later. Similarly, if localization is an afterthought, it will be very difficult to put in place. Bottom line, if you don't have all visible strings stored externally in a standard place, it will be very difficult to find all that need to be localized. One other note, very strictly avoid concatenating visible strings directly, such as Instead, you must use something like The reason for this is that different languages often order the words differently, and concatenating strings directly will need a new build to fix, but if you used some kind of string replacement mechanism like above, you can modify your .resx file (or whatever localization files you use) for the specific language that needs to reorder the words.
1120 I've just set up Sandcastle again. Try installing it (the May 2008 release) and search for SandcastleGui.exe or something similar (it's in the examples folder or so). Click Add Assembly and add your Assembly or Assemblies, add any .xml Documentation files (the ones generated by the compiler if you enabled that option) and then Build. It will take some time, but the result will be worth the effort. It will actually look up stuff from MSDN, so your resulting documentation will also have the Class Inheritance all the way down to System.Object with links to MSDN and stuff. Sandcastle seems a bit complicated at first, especially when you want to use it in an automated build, but I am absolutely sure it will be worth the effort. Also have a look at Sandcastle Help File Builder, this is a somewhat more advanced GUI for it.
1248 Jeff, your code is nice but could be clearer with constants (as suggested in Code Complete).
1281 You can use the artifact directory variable inside the MSBuild script itself. Here's an example of how I'm running FxCop right now from my CC.Net MSBuild script (this script is what CC.Net points to - there is also a "Build" target in the script that includes an MSBuild task against the SLN to do the actual compilation):
1332 Why not use LINQ: This would also allow for great flexibility in that you can select the top 10, 20 10% etc. Or if you are using your word frequency index for type-ahead, you could also include StartsWith clause as well.
1375 On windows, curses works out of the box, ncurses doesn't, and for a progress bar curses should be sufficient. So, use curses instead of ncurses. Also, both curses and ncurses are wafer-thin wrappers around the c library - that means you don't really need Ruby-specific tutorials. However, on the site for the PickAxe you can download all the code examples for the book. The file "ex1423.rb" contains a curses demo which plays Pong - that should give you plenty of material to get you going.
1378 Personally I think curses is overkill in this case. While the curses lib is nice (and I frequently use it myself) it's a PITA to relearn every time I haven't needed it for 12 months which has to be the sign of a bad interface design. If for some reason you can't get on with the progress bar lib Joey suggested roll your own and release it under a pretty free licence for instant kudos :)
1404 For some reason Jeff's code didn't seem simple enough. To me this seems simpler and easier to understand:
1517 MacVim works well and certainly looks more mature than Vim-Cocoa, moreover there is a Cocoa plugin architecture in the pipeline for MacVim (and someone is already working on a TextMate style file browser tray plugin which is a huge ++ IMHO). There was also a Carbon version of Vim, but this didn't offer a great deal over the Terminal version. i.e. only allowed one window open, not very OSX in appearence... Aquamacs is very usable and looks pretty good. Supports both traditional Mac OS style keyboard shortcuts (command-O, command-S) and the Control/Meta shortcuts for those raised on traditional Emacs. It is definitely more Mac-like than Carbon Emacs. It seems stable and fast, but I am not an Emacs guru so I don't stress it all that much when I use it. I can't speak to the extensiveness of the included elisp packages, either. Someone syncs Carbon Emacs with the upstream tree quarterly I think. Aquamacs has a more irregular schedule, but it's seen some pretty major updates over the last year.

1879 For the record here's the results on Mac:
2511 Red-black is better than AVL for insertion-heavy applications. If you foresee relatively uniform look-up, then Red-black is the way to go. If you foresee a relatively unbalanced look-up where more recently viewed elements are more likely to be viewed again, you want to use splay trees.
3115 I use hpricot on ruby. As an example this is a snippet of code that I use to retrieve all book titles from the 6 pages of my HireThings account (as they don't seem to provide a single page with this info) It's pretty much complete. All that comes before this are library imports and the settings for my proxy.
4313 try the following this should work for what you need
7678 My opinions on these are: While it appears to make sense for the simple selection (select * from Orders) it makes less sense for the OO equivalent (Orders x = new Orders). A table in a DB is really the set of that entity, it makes more sense once you're using set-logic: That last line, the actual logic of the join, looks confusing with plural table names. I'm not sure about always using an alias (as Matt suggests) clears that up. They should be singular as they only hold 1 property Never, if the column name is ambiguous (as above where they both have a column called [Key]) the name of the table (or its alias) can distinguish them well enough. You want queries to be quick to type and simple - prefixes add unnecessary complexity. Whatever you want, I'd suggest CapitalCase I don't think there's one set of absolute guidelines on any of these. As long as whatever you pick is consistent across the application or DB I don't think it really matters.
8034 GateKiller, In simple terms (and not a copy-paste out of the SQLBOL) so you can understand the concepts: RESTORE WITH RECOVERY uses the backup media file (eg. fulldata.bak) to restore the database to back to the time that backup file was created. This is great if you want to go back in time to restore the database to an earlier state - like when developing a system. If you want to restore the database TO THE VERY LATEST DATA, (i.e. like if your doing a system Disaster Recovery and you cannot lose any data) then you want to restore that backup AND THEN all the transaction logs created since that backup. This is when you use RESTORE NORECOVERY. It will allow you to restore the later transaction logs right up to the point of failure (as long as you have them). RECOVERY WITH STANDBY is the ability to restore the database up to a parital date (like NORECOVERY above) but to allow the database still to be used READONLY. New transaction logs can still be applied to the database to keep it up to date (a standby server). Use this when it would take too long to restore a full database in order to Return To Operations the system. (ie. if you have a multi TB database that would take 16 hours to restore, but could receive transaction log updates every 15 minutes). This is a bit like a mirror server - but without having "every single transaction" send to the backup server in real time.
8078 If you understand the process of retain/release then there are two golden rules that are "duh" obvious to established Cocoa programmers, but unfortunately are rarely spelled out this clearly for newcomers. **1) If a function which returns an object has 'alloc', 'create' or 'copy' in its name then the object is yours. You must call [object release] when you are finished with it. Or CFRelease(object) if it's a Core-Foundation object. You would be well served to also follow this convention in functions you create yourself. (Nitpickers: Yes, there are unfortunately a few API calls that are exceptions to these rules but they are rare).
8462 You can also do this I find the bit-shifting easier than typing 4,8,16,32 and so on. It has no impact on your code because it's all done at compile time
12087 The problem here is that the browsers specifically work to block anything that changes the basic file upload input control. You can't change it with javascript for instance. The reason is security - if I could script it I could build a page that when you visited it sent me various files from your hard disk. Not nice. There are various workarounds at the moment, but they're different between IE and FX (I don't know about Safari, Opera, etc). Look at what http://www.gmail.com does in IE and FX when you attach something to an e-mail. I want to see that rubbish "Browse" button - it tells me that I'm not letting anything unexpected in.
13756 TortoiseSVN 1.5 has a neat hidden feature on the check in window: Select a missing file and a new file and right-click. One of the options will be "fix move". I tend to refactor away, and then use this to fix any files where the name has changed.
14960 This does the job: Edit: In response to pix0rs concern - yes you are correct that you will not be able to programatically close the app. However, you can simply remove the event handler for the form_closing event before closing the form:
16104 It's rather ugly: I tend to simplify this with: Then I can do: One option suggested in the comments is to add an extension, which is simple enough: Finally, you may want to have a default enum to use if the string cannot be parsed: Which makes this the call: However, I would be careful adding an extension method like this to string as (without namespace control) it will appear on all instances of string whether they hold an enum or not (so 1234.ToString().ToEnum(StatusEnum.None) would be valid but nonsensical) . It's often be best to avoid cluttering Microsoft's core classes with extra methods that only apply in very specific contexts unless your entire development team has a very good understanding of what those extensions do.
16381 The hash code of an object shouldn't be unique. The checking rule is: All you want is a GetHashCode algorithm that splits up your collection into roughly even groups - it shouldn't form the key as the HashTable or Dictionary<> will need to use the hash to optimise retrieval. How long do you expect the data to be? How random? If lengths vary greatly (say for files) then just return the length. If lengths are likely to be similar look at a subset of the bytes that varies. GetHashCode should be a lot quicker than Equals, but doesn't need to be unique. Two identical things must never have different hash codes. Two different objects should not have the same hash code, but some collisions are to be expected (after all, there are more permutations than possible 32 bit integers).
16749 Note that Zend Optimizer and MMCache (or similar applications) are totally different things. While Zend Optimizer tries to optimize the program opcode MMCache will cache the scripts in memory and reuse the precompiled code. I did some benchmarks some time ago and you can find the results in my blog (in German though). The basic results: Zend Optimizer alone didn't help at all. Actually my scripts were slower than without optimizer. When it comes to caches: And: You DO want to install a opcode cache! For example: alt text http://blogs.interdose.com/dominik/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/opcode_wordpress.png This is the duration it took to call the wordpress homepage 10.000 times. Edit: BTW, eAccelerator contains an optimizer itself.
17916 Here's another extension method that I use for custom rendering: Then, to render a custom composite in the RenderContents() method I write this:

19343 zip is its own inverse! Provided you use the special * operator. The way this works is by calling zip with the arguments: â€¦ except the arguments are passed to zip directly (after being converted to a tuple), so there's no need to worry about the number of arguments getting too big.
20431 That doesn't really cause leaks, it just makes more work for the GC: Leaving disposable components lying around like this is never much of a problem in a managed environment like .Net - that's a big part of what managed means. You'll slow you app down, certainly. But you won't leave a mess for anything else.
24156 could you clarify a little bit more how it was for you, what you had to change. Maybe you could point me in the right direction by providing some links to the information you used. Depending on the platform, they're quite well-written and can also be found on the internet. In the case of make, I actually read the complete documentation which took a few hours. Actually, I don't think this is necessary or helpful in most cases but I had a few special requirements in my first assignments under Linux that required a sophisticated makefile. After writing the makefile I gave it to an experienced colleague who did some minor tweaks and corrections. After that, I pretty much knew make. I used GVIM because I had some (but not much) prior experience there, I can't say anything at all about Emacs or alternatives. I find it really helps to read other peoples' .gvimrc config file. Many people put it on the web. Here's mine. Syntax highlighting: yes, and a much better one than Visual Studio. Code completion: yes-ish. First, I have to admit that I didn't use C++ code completion even in Visual Studio because (compared to VB and C#) it wasn't good enough. I don't use it often now but nevertheless, GVIM has native code completion support for C++. Combined with the ctags library and a plug-in like taglist this is almost an IDE. do you have to compile first before getting (syntax) errors? and how do you debug (again think breakpoints etc)? Like I said, I had the 'pleasure' to set my first steps in the Java programming language using windows notepad and the command line java compiler in high school, and it was, .. wel a nightmare! certainly when I could compare it with other programming courses I had back then where we had decent IDE's You shouldn't even try to compare a modern, full-feature editor like Emacs or GVIM to Notepad. Notepad is an embellished TextBox control, and this really makes all the difference. Additionally, working on the command line is a very different experience in Linux and Windows. The Windows cmd.exe is severely crippled. PowerShell is much better. /EDIT: I should mention explicitly that GVIM has tabbed editing (as in tabbed browsing, not tabs-vs-spaces)! It took me ages to find them although they're not hidden at all. Just type :tabe instead of plain :e when opening a file or creating a new one, and GVIM will create a new tab. Switching between tabs can be done using the cursor or several different shortcuts (depending on the platform). The key gt (type g, then t in command mode) should work everywhere, and jumps to the next tab, or tab no. n if a number was given. Type :help gt to get more help.
24296 Used like this:
24904 [Executive Summary: Use ++i if you don't have a specific reason to use i++.] For C++, the answer is a bit more complicated. If i is a simple type (not an instance of a C++ class) then the answer given for C holds, since the compiler is generating the code. However, if i is an instance of a C++ class, then i++ and ++i are making calls to the operator++() function. Here's a standard pair of these functions: Since the compiler isn't generating code, but just calling the operator++ function, there is no way to optimize away the tmp variable and its associated copy constructor. If the copy constructor is expensive then this can have a significant performance impact. (thanks to Paul for inquiring about the difference between C and C++.)
25139 I prefer the GD library - check out the Examples, and this example: Outputs: imagecreatetrucolor example http://uk2.php.net/manual/en/figures/image.imagecreatetruecolor.png See imagecreatetruecolor.
25597 After reviewing your question and the answers given, I came up with this: Since the "-" is optional, you don't need to include it. I am not sure what you was using the {4} at the end for? This will find the matches based on what you want, then using the MatchCollection you can access each match to rebuild the string.
28421 IIf() runs both the true and false code. For simple things like numeric assignment, this isn't a big deal. But for code that requires any sort of processing, you're wasting cycles running the condition that doesn't match, and possibly causing side effects. Code illustration: Outputs:
28811 Read all the answers but I think lambdas and type inferrence is underrated. Havn't seen anyone mentioned that Lambdas can have multiple statement and they double as a compatible delegate object automatically (just make sure the signature match) as in: Note that I don't have a new CancellationEventHandler nor do I have to specify types of sender and e, they're inferrable from the event. Which is why this is less cumbersome to writing the whole delegate (blah blah) which also requires you to specify types of parameters. Lambdas doesn't need to return anything and type inference is extremely powerful in context like this. and BTW, you can always return Lambdas that make Lambdas in the functional programming sense. For example, here's a lambda that make a lambda that handles a Button.Click event: Note the chaining: (dx, dy) => (sender, e) => Now that's why I'm happy to have taken the functional programming class :-) Other than the pointers in C, I think its the other fundamental thing you should learn :-) EDIT: Man this is awesome! A lot of things I've never knew before haha, I'd definitely favorites this if I can.
28937 I have run several benchmarks with eAcclerator, APC, XCache and (even though it is a optimizer, not a cache) Zend Optimizer Benchmark Results http://blogs.interdose.com/dominik/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/opcode_wordpress.png Result: eAccelerator is fastest (in all tests), followed by XCache and APC. (The one in the diagram is the number of seconds to call a WordPress home page 10,000 times). Zend Optimizer made everything slower (!).
29124 The hard way: You may want a recursive decent parser. To get precedence you need to think recursively, for example, using your sample string, to do this manually, you would have to read the 1, then see the plus and start a whole new recursive parse "session" starting with 11... and make sure to parse the 11 * 5 into its own factor, yielding a parse tree with 1 + (11 * 5). This all feels so painful even to attempt to explain, especially with the added powerlessness of C. See, after parsing the 11, if the * was actually a + instead, you would have to abandon the attempt at making a term and instead parse the 11 itself as a factor. My head is already exploding. It's possible with the recursive decent strategy, but there is a better way... The easy (right) way If you use a GPL tool like Bison, you probably don't need to worry about licensing issues since the C code generated by bison is not covered by the GPL (IANAL but I'm pretty sure GPL tools don't force the GPL on generated code/binaries; for example Apple compiles code like say, Aperture with GCC and they sell it without having to GPL said code). Download Bison (or something equivalent, ANTLR, etc.): http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/ There is usually some sample code that you can just run bison on and get your desired C code that demonstrates this four function calculator: http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_mono/bison.html#Infix-Calc Look at the generated code, and see that this is not as easy as it sounds. Also, the advantages of using a tool like Bison are 1) you learn something (especially if you read the Dragon book and learn about grammars), 2) you avoid NIH trying to reinvent the wheel. With a real parser-generator tool, you actually have a hope at scaling up later, showing other people you know that parsers are the domain of parsing tools. Update: People here have offered much sound advice. My only warning against skipping the parsing tools or just using the Shunting Yard algorithm or a hand rolled recursive decent parser is that little toy languages[1] may someday turn into big actual languages with functions (sin, cos, log) and variables, conditions and for loops. Flex/Bison may very well be overkill for a small, simple interpreter, but a one off parser+evaluator may cause trouble down the line when changes need to be made or features need to be added. Your situation will vary and you will need to use your judgement; just don't punish other people for your sins [2] and build a less than adequate tool. My favorite tool for parsing The best tool in the world for the job is the Parsec library (for recursive decent parsers) which comes with the programming language Haskell. It looks a lot like BNF, or like some specialized tool or domain specific language for parsing (sample code [3]), but it is in fact just a regular library in Haskell, meaning that it compiles in the same build step as the rest of your Haskell code, and you can write arbitrary Haskell code and call that within your parser, and you can mix and match other libraries all in the same code. (Embedding a parsing language like this in a language other than Haskell results in loads of syntactic cruft, by the way. I did this in C# and it works quite well but it is not so pretty and succinct.) Notes: [1] Richard Stallman says, in Why you should not use Tcl The principal lesson of Emacs is that a language for extensions should not be a mere "extension language". It should be a real programming language, designed for writing and maintaining substantial programs. Because people will want to do that! [2] Yes, I am forever scarred from using that "language". Also note that when I submitted this entry, the preview was correct, but SO's less than adequate parser ate my close anchor tag on the first paragraph, proving that parsers are not something to be trifled with because if you use regexes and one off hacks you will probably get something subtle and small wrong. [3] Snippet of a Haskell parser using Parsec: a four function calculator extended with exponents, parentheses, whitespace for multiplication, and constants (like pi and e).
29130 Another option for perl would be WebScraper which is based on Ruby's Scrapi. In a nutshell, with nice and concise syntax you can get robust scraper directly into datastructures.
29248 Steve Yegge talks fun but there is money to be made in working out what other people's requirements are so i'd take his article with a pinch of salt. Requirements gathering is incredibly tough because of the manner in which communication works. Its a four step process that is lossy in each step. And humans fuck this up constantly, through their adorable imperfections. Agile does right in promoting iterative development. Getting early versions out to the client is important in identifying what features are most important (what ships in 0.1 - 0.5 ish), helps to keep you both on the right track in terms of how the application will work and quickly identifies the hidden features that you will miss. The two main problem scenarios are the two ends of the scales: Yegge does well in pointing out that domain experts are essential to produce good requirements because they know the business and have worked in it. They can help identify the core desire of the client and will help explain how their staff will use the system and what is important to the staff. Alternatives and additions include trying to do the job yourself to get into the mindset or having a client staff member occasionally on-site, although the latter is unlikely to happen. The feature pit is the other side, mostly full of failed government IT projects. Too much, too soon, not enough thought or application of realism (but what do you expect they have only about four years to make themselves feel important?). The aim here is to work out what the customer really wants. As long as you work on getting the core components correct, efficient and bug-free clients usually remain tolerant of missing features that arrive in later shipments, as long as they eventually arrive. This is where iterative development really helps. Remember to separate the client's ideas of what the program will be like and what they want the program to achieve. Some clients can create confusion by communicating their requirements in the form of application features which may be poorly thought out or made redundant by much simpler functionality then they think they require. While I'm not advocating calling the client an idiot or not listening to them I feel that it is worth forever asking why they want a particular feature to get to its underlying purpose. Remember that in either scenario it is of imperative importantance to root out the quickest path to fulfilling the customers core need and put you in a scenario where you are both profiting from the relationship.
30197 See http://caniuse.com/#search=worker for the most up-to-date support info. The following was the state of support circa 2009. The words you want to google for are JavaScript Worker Threads Apart from from Gears there's nothing available right now, but there's plenty of talk about how to implement this so I guess watch this question as the answer will no doubt change in future. Here's the relevant documentation for Gears: WorkerPool API WHATWG has a Draft Recommendation for worker threads: Web Workers And there's also Mozillaâ€™s DOM Worker Threads Update: June 2009, current state of browser support for JavaScript threads Firefox 3.5 has web workers. Some demos of web workers, if you want to see them in action: The Gears plugin can also be installed in Firefox. Safari 4, and the WebKit nightlies have worker threads: Chrome has Gears baked in, so it can do threads, although it requires a confirmation prompt from the user (and it uses a different API to web workers, although it will work in any browser with the Gears plugin installed): IE8 and IE9 can only do threads with the Gears plugin installed
31056 Will this do? Basically it matches a '\n' that is preceded with a character that is not '\r'. If you want it to detect lines that start with just a single '\n' as well, then try Which says that it should match a '\n' but only those that is the first character of a line or those that are not preceded with '\r' There might be special cases to check since you're messing with the definition of lines itself the '$' might not work too well. But I think you should get the idea. EDIT: credit @Kibbee Using look-ahead s is clearly better since it won't capture the matched preceding character and should help with any edge cases as well. So here's a better regex + the code becomes:

32386 I'm not sure if it'll work in all browsers but you should try setting autocomplete="off" on the form. The easiest and simplest way to disable Form and Password storage prompts and prevent form data from being cached in session history is to use the autocomplete form element attribute with value "off" From http://developer.mozilla.org/En/How_to_Turn_Off_Form_Autocompletion Some minor research shows that this works in IE to but I'll leave no guarantees ;)
33516 Hibernate is written against the JDBC API. So, you need a JDBC driver that works with the file format you are interested in. Obviously, even for read-only access, this isn't going to perform well, but it might still be useful if that's not a high priority. On a Windows system, you can set up ODBC datasources for delimited text files, Excel files, etc. Then you can set up the JdbcOdbcDriver in your Java application to use this data source. For most of the applications I work on, I would not consider this approach; I would use an import/export mechanism to convert from a real database (even if it's an in-process database like Berkeley DB or Derby) to the text files. Yes, it's an extra step, but it could be automated, and the performance isn't likely to be much worse than trying to use the text files directly (it will likely be much better, overall), and it will be more robust and easy to develop.
33528 After losing some freelance work to a hard drive crash, I've become keen on the philosophy that "It doesn't exist until its in source control". As I don't want to necessarily share the source for my projects with the rest of the world, I pay for webhosting (using Dreamhost who have great deals on basic shared hosting and easy one-click installs for things like subversion) and store my data that way. They don't claim to be any sort of backup service, but all I really want is a second copy offsite somewhere. If I do decide to share the code I can always make it public later. Do note that sourceforge does not allow private/personal projects, and Google Code forces you to license your code using an open source license. Both have some limitations on the number of projects you can create (and aren't really intended to store everybody and their brother's personal projects). Assembla and Github both appear to be very attractive pay options, but your dollars go a lot further by paying for webhosting rather than a specific hosted app.

36731 I've seen it in coding standards for C++ that were a hang-over from C, as if you don't have RAII or other automatic memory management then you have to clean up for each return, which either means cut-and-paste of the clean-up or a goto (logically the same as 'finally' in managed languages), both of which are considered bad form. If your practices are to use smart pointers and collections in C++ or another automatic memory system, then there isn't a strong reason for it, and it become all about readability, and more of a judgement call.

37687 Add a "g" to the end of the regular expression to enable global matching. For example: Update: I've only fixed the problem in the question where the regular expression was only replacing the first match. The regular expression above probably misses a lot of edge cases. See the Jeff Atwood's blog post The Problem With URLs for a better method of finding URLs in text.
38578 Assuming you're joining on columns with no duplicates, which is by far the most common case: An inner join of A and B gives the result of A intersect B, i.e. the inner part of a venn diagram intersection. An outer join of A and B gives the results of A union B, i.e. the outer parts of a venn diagram union. Examples Suppose you have two Tables, with a single column each, and data as follows: Note that (1,2) are unique to A, (3,4) are common, and (5,6) are unique to B. inner join An inner join using either of the equivalent queries gives the intersection of the two tables, i.e. the two rows they have in common. left outer join A left outer join will give all rows in A, plus any common rows in B. full outer join A full outer join will give you the union of A and B, i.e. All the rows in A and all the rows in B. If something in A doesn't have a corresponding datum in B, then the B portion is null, and vice versa.
38666 You mean change the text file before it's committed? You can (I'm not sure how), but it's generally not a good idea, as it doesn't tell the client about the change, so the local copies become void on a commit. What I would do is block the commit (non zero exit), and give an error message as to why you don't want that revision to go through.
38990 In your case, what you can do is: This will, as you want it, put the final dict in z, and make the value for key b be properly overridden by the second (y) dict's value: If you use Python 3, it is only a little more complicated. To create z:
39128 pek, for a short term fix apply one of the solutions suggested by other users. For a mid to long term plan you should consider migrating to one of existing web frameworks. They handle all low-level stuff like routing and files inclusion in reliable, secure way, so you can focus on core functionalities. Do not reinvent the wheel. Use a framework. Any of them is better than none. The initial time investment in learning it pays back almost instantly.

40894 HashMap: An implementation of the Map interface that uses hash codes to index an array. Hashtable: Hi, 1998 called. They want their collections API back. Seriously though, you're better off staying away from Hashtable altogether. For single-threaded apps, you don't need the extra overhead of syncrhonisation. For highly concurrent apps, the paranoid synchronisation might lead to starvation, deadlocks, or unnecessary garbage collection pauses. Like Tim Howland pointed out, you might use ConcurrentHashMap instead.
41156 Here is code for secure, easy, but a little bit more expensive session identifiers. This works by choosing 130 bits from a cryptographically secure random bit generator, and encoding them in base-32. 128 bits is considered to be cryptographically strong, but each digit in a base 32 number can encode 5 bits, so 128 is rounded up to the next multiple of 5. This encoding is compact and efficient, with 5 random bits per character. Compare this to a random UUID, which only has 3.4 bits per character in standard layout, and only 122 random bits in total. If you allow session identifiers to be easily guessable (too short, flawed random number generator, etc.), attackers can hijack other's sessions. Note that SecureRandom objects are expensive to initialize, so you'll want to keep one around and reuse it. Here is alternative code for cheap, insecure random alpha-numeric strings. You can tweak the "symbols" if you want to use more characters.
41463 The commonly available system properties are documented in the System.getProperties() method. As Chris said "user.name" is the property to get the user running your app.
42665 @@IDENTITY is the last identity inserted using the current SQL Connection. This is a good value to return from an insert stored procedure, where you just need the identity inserted for your new record, and don't care if more rows were added afterward. SCOPE_IDENTITY is the last identity inserted using the current SQL Connection, and in the current scope -- that is, if there was a second IDENTITY inserted based on a trigger after your insert, it would not be reflected in SCOPE_IDENTITY, only the insert you performed. Frankly, I have never had a reason to use this. IDENT_CURRENT(tablename) is the last identity inserted regardless of connection or scope. You could use this if you want to get the current IDENTITY value for a table that you have not inserted a record into.
43496 If you're happy to use Apache classes, you could use org.apache.commons.lang.RandomStringUtils (commons-lang).
43792 I've found this to be a language and programming-paradigm thing. One paradigm â€” OOP â€” refers to objects with member methods, which conceptually are how you send messages to those objects (this view is reflected in UML, for example). Another paradigm â€” functional â€” may or may not involve classes of objects, but functions are merely the atomic unit of work. In structured programming, you had sub-routines (notice that the prefix "sub" implies structure). In imperative programming (which overlaps with structured quite a lot, but a slightly different way of looking at things), you have a more formulaic view of the world, and so 'functions' represent some operation (often mathematical). All you have to do to not sound like a rube is to use the terminology used by the language reference for the language you're using.

46181 Using regular expressions is probably the best way. Here's an example (live demo): But keep in mind that one should not rely only upon JavaScript validation. JavaScript can easily be disabled. This should be validated on the server side as well.
46491 From the PHP documentation for htmlentities: This function is identical to htmlspecialchars() in all ways, except with htmlentities(), all characters which have HTML character entity equivalents are translated into these entities. From the PHP documentation for htmlspecialchars: Certain characters have special significance in HTML, and should be represented by HTML entities if they are to preserve their meanings. This function returns a string with some of these conversions made; the translations made are those most useful for everyday web programming. If you require all HTML character entities to be translated, use htmlentities() instead. The difference is what gets encoded. The choices are everything (entities) or "special" characters, like ampersand, double and single quotes, less than, and greater than (specialchars). I prefer to use htmlspecialchars whenever possible.
47628 No, not quite. Firstly, there's a slight difference in semantics. If a is null, then a.concat(b) NPEs but a+=b will treat the original value of a as if it were null. Furthermore, the concat() method only accepts String values while the + operator will silently convert the argument to a String (using the toString() method for objects). So the concat() method is more strict in what it accepts. To look under the hood, write a simple class with a += b; Now disassemble with javap -c (included in the Sun JDK). You should see a listing including: So, a += b is the equivalent of The concat method should be faster. However, with more strings the StringBuilder method wins, at least in terms of performance. The source code of String and StringBuilder (and its package-private base class) is available in src.zip of the Sun JDK. You can see that you are building up a char array (resizing as necessary) and then throwing it away when you create the final String. In practice memory allocation is surprisingly fast.
68611 There is no syntax in C++ nor C# for the second method you mentioned. There's nothing wrong with your first method. If however you have very big ranges, just use a series of if statements.
68826 If you want the extension to only be available for the specified type you simply just need to specify the actual type you will be handling something like... Note intellisense will then only display the extension method when you declare your (in this case) ViewPage with the matching type. Also, best not to use the System.Web.Mvc namespace, I know its convenient to not have to include your namespace in the usings section, but its far more maintainable if you create your own extensions namespace for your extension functions.
68950 This is more of a work-around than a true solution.

70765 I've been using screen for over 10 years and probably use less than half the features. So it's definitely not necessary to learn all its features right away (and I wouldn't recommend trying). My day-to-day commands are: I think that's it. I sometimes use the split screen features, but certainly not daily. The other tip is if screen seems to have locked up because you hit some random key combination by accident, do both ^Q and ^A ^Q to try to unlock it.
70802 What is GNU Screen? Great! Erm, a slightly more useful answer: it allows you to run multiple console applications, or commands, in one terminal. Kind of like a tabbed terminal emulator. In fact, that's exactly what it is (just not done with the regular GUI toolkits) Why is it so great? Simple, you can run a program in a screen session (Run screen and it runs your default shell, run screen myapp and it runs myapp in the session), hit ctrl+a (the screen control sequence) and then press d (ctrl+a,d) to detach. The program keeps running in the background, but, unlike doing mycmd &, you can run screen -r to reattach the session, and everything is as you left it. You can send input to the command, if it's a curses UI, everything still works just like if it were a "real" terminal. It's very popular with console IRC clients - you can run (say) screen irssi and reattach the session from anywhere you can SSH from. A few useful commands: A few other useful things I've stumbled across:

74664 The first thing I'd do is lay a piece of paper or a book over your arrow keys and your ins/home/end/pgup/down keys. Those aren't needed in Vi. Next I'd get used to hitting ctrl+[ whenever you're told to hit escape. It's much faster and you won't need to take your hands off the keyboard. Then I'd watch my screencasts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcpQ7koECgk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6WCm6z5msk http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPDoI7gflxM http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1_CfIb-3X4 Then, just practice practice practice. edit The reason for avoiding the arrow keys is that they slow you down. One of the largest benefits of Vim is the speed it allows you. The arrow keys also prevent you from really embracing the modal nature, which is very powerful when mastered.
74672 First of all, you may want to pick up Vim; it has a vastly superior feature set along with everything vi has. That said, it takes discipline to learn. If you have a job and can't afford the productivity hit (without getting fired), I'd suggest taking on a weekend project for the sole purpose of learning the editor. Keep its documentation open as you work, and be disciplined enough not to chicken out. As you learn more, become efficient and start relying on muscle memory, it won't be as hard to stick with it. I've been using Vim for so long that I don't even think about what keys to press to search or navigate or save. And my hands never leave the keyboard. To use Vim is one of the best choices I've made in my programming career.

78155 Timestamps in Javascript
79022 For HTML 4, the answer is technically: ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). HTML 5 is even more permissive, saying only that an id must contain at least one character and may not contain any space characters. The id attribute is case sensitive in XHTML. As a purely practical matter, you may want to avoid certain characters. Periods, colons and '#' have special meaning in CSS selectors, so you will have to escape those characters using a backslash in CSS or a double backslash in a selector string passed to jQuery. Think about how often you will have to escape a character in your stylesheets or code before you go crazy with periods and colons in ids. For example, the HTML declaration <div id="first.name"></div> is valid. You can select that element in CSS as #first\.name and in jQuery like so: $('#first\\.name'). But if you forget the backslash, $('#first.name'), you will have a perfectly valid selector looking for an element with id first and also having class name. This is a bug that is easy to overlook. You might be happier in the long run choosing the id first-name (a hyphen rather than a period), instead. You can simplify your development tasks by strictly sticking to a naming convention. For example, if you limit yourself entirely to lower-case characters and always separate words with either hyphens or underscores (but not both, pick one and never use the other), then you have an easy-to-remember pattern. You will never wonder "was it firstName or FirstName?" because you will always know that you should type first_name. Prefer camel case? Then limit yourself to that, no hyphens or underscores, and always, consistently use either upper-case or lower-case for the first character, don't mix them. A now very obscure problem was that at least one browser, Netscape 6, incorrectly treated id attribute values as case-sensitive. That meant that if you had typed id="firstName" in your HTML (lower-case 'f') and #FirstName { color: red } in your CSS (upper-case 'F'), that buggy browser would have failed to set the element's color to red. At the time of this edit, April 2015, I hope you aren't being asked to support Netscape 6. Consider this a historical footnote.

81329 The performance problem here is the cost of creating a new function object at each iteration of the loop and not the fact that you use an anonymous function: You are creating a thousand distinct function objects even though they have the same body of code and no binding to the lexical scope (closure). The following seems faster, on the other hand, because it simply assigns the same function reference to the array elements throughout the loop: If you were to create the anonymous function before entering the loop, then only assign references to it to the array elements while inside the loop, you will find that there is no performance or semantic difference whatsoever when compared to the named function version: In short, there is no observable performance cost to using anonymous over named functions. As an aside, it may appear from above that there is no difference between: and: The former is a function declaration whereas the latter is a variable assignment to an anonymous function. Although they may appear to have the same effect, JavaScript does treat them slightly differently. To understand the difference, I recommend reading, â€œJavaScript function declaration ambiguityâ€?.
81427 Works on source code: Works on assembly: The problem with assembly "parsing" is that we have less informations about line and file (the informations is based on .pdb file, and Pdb contains lines informations only for methods) I personnaly recommend Mono.Cecil and NRefactory.

82553 Someone here has just suggested sudoing tee: This could also be used to redirect any command, to a directory that you do not have access to. It works because the tee program is effectively an "echo to a file" program, and the redirect to /dev/null is to stop it also outputting to the screen to keep it the same as the original contrived example above.

84986 The majority of professional web developers seem to oppose you[citation needed]. That tables are in fact less maintainable should be obvious. Using tables for layout means that changing the corporate layout will in fact mean changing every single page. This can be very expensive. On the other hand, judicious use of semantically meaningful HTML combined with CSS might confine such changes to the CSS and the pictures used.

85206 Note that if you need to use i.remove(); in your loop, or access the actual iterator in some way, you cannot use the for( : ) idiom, since the actual Iterator is merely inferred. As was noted by Denis Bueno, this code works for any object that implements the Iterable interface. Also, if the right-hand side of the for(:) idiom is an array rather than an Iterable object, the internal code uses an int index counter and checks against array.length instead.

The other option which I also found very usefull is to be able to dump a map of the whole virtual space based on VirtualQuery function. My code for this looks like this:
91795 If you have only just popped it and the terminal is still open, you will still have the hash value printed by git stash pop on screen (thanks, Dolda). Otherwise, you can find it using this: This will show you all the commits at the tips of your commit graph which are no longer referenced from any branch or tag – every lost commit, including every stash commit you’ve ever created, will be somewhere in that graph. The easiest way to find the stash commit you want is probably to pass that list to gitk: This will launch a repository browser showing you every single commit in the repository ever, regardless of whether it is reachable or not. You can replace gitk there with something like git log --graph --oneline --decorate if you prefer a nice graph on the console over a separate GUI app. To spot stash commits, look for commit messages of this form: WIP on somebranch: commithash Some old commit message Note: The commit message will only be in this form (starting with "WIP on") if you did not supply a message when you did git stash. Once you know the hash of the commit you want, you can apply it as a stash: Or you can use the context menu in gitk to create branches for any unreachable commits you are interested in. After that, you can do whatever you want with them with all the normal tools. When you’re done, just blow those branches away again.
92071 Perhaps it is attaching to "the wrong kind" of code. In the "Attach to Process" dialog, there is a setting that allows you to select the kind of code you want to debug. Try clicking "Select" button next to "Attach to" text box and checking only "Managed code" the relevant code type. Most of the time, leaving "automatically determine the type of code to debug" setting on works for me. However, in some cases, the debugger is not able to understand that I want to attach to managed code (if I have launched my application from a batch file, for example) and when it does that, the above solution works for me.

97290 Once you've embedded the third-party assembly as a resource, add code to subscribe to the AppDomain.AssemblyResolve event of the current domain during application start-up. This event fires whenever the Fusion sub-system of the CLR fails to locate an assembly according to the probing (policies) in effect. In the event handler for AppDomain.AssemblyResolve, load the resource using Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream and feed its content as a byte array into the corresponding Assembly.Load overload. Below is how one such implementation could look like in C#: where StreamToBytes could be defined as: Finally, as a few have already mentioned, ILMerge may be another option to consider, albeit somewhat more involved.
98702 The best explanation I have found is by Mike Acton, Understanding Strict Aliasing. It's focused a little on PS3 development, but that's basically just GCC. From the article: "Strict aliasing is an assumption, made by the C (or C++) compiler, that dereferencing pointers to objects of different types will never refer to the same memory location (i.e. alias each other.)" So basically if you have an int* pointing to some memory containing an int and then you point a float* to that memory and use it as a float you break the rule. If your code does not respect this, then the compiler's optimizer will most likely break your code. The exception to the rule is a char*, which is allowed to point to any type.

135454 My initial reaction was '#ifdef, of course', but I think #if actually has some significant advantages for this - here's why: First, you can use 'DEBUG_ENABLED' in preprocessor and compiled tests. Example - Often, I want longer timeouts when debug is enabled, so using #if, I can write this ... instead of ... Second, you're in a better position if you want to migrate from a #define to a global constant. #defines are usually frowned on by most C++ programmers. And, Third, you say you've a divide in your team. My guess is this means different members have already adopted different approaches, and you need to standardise. Ruling that #if is the preferred choice means that code using #ifdef will compile -and run- even when DEBUG_ENABLED is false. And it's much easier to track down and remove debug output that is produced when it shouldn't be than vice-versa. Oh, and a minor readability point. You should be able to use true/false rather than 0/1 in your #define, and because the value is a single lexical token, it's the one time you don't need parentheses around it. instead of

140749 The theoretical limit may be 2,147,483,647, but the practical limit is nowhere near that. Since no single object in a .Net program may be over 2GB and the string type uses unicode (2 bytes for each character), the best you could do is 1,073,741,823, but you're not likely to ever be able to allocate that on a 32-bit machine. This is one of those situations where "If you have to ask, you're probably doing something wrong."
140861 Here's a solution that I think is better than any posted so far: Reasons why it is an improvement: Safe with leading zeros (unlike BigInteger) and with negative byte values (unlike Byte.parseByte) Doesn't convert the String into a char[], or create StringBuilder and String objects for every single byte. No library dependencies that may not be available Feel free to add argument checking via assert or exceptions if the argument is not known to be safe.

143188 Maybe concatenate the current working directory with argv[0]? I'm not sure if that would work in Windows but it works in linux. For example: When run, it outputs: jeremy@jeremy-desktop:~/Desktop$ ./test /home/jeremy/Desktop/./test
143671 No. It's very easy to check. Should print: Technically that could have been a compiler bug, implementation dependent, unspeicifed behaviour, or something. However, the JLS is pretty well nailed down and the compilers could enough for these sort of simple things (generics corner case may be a different matter). Alos note, if you swap around the two catch blocks, it wont compile. The second catch would be completely unreachable. Note finally is always called even if a catch is executed. (other than silly cases, such as infinite loops, attaching through the tools interface and killing the thread, rewriting bytecode, etc.).
144673 You need to go to http://support.microsoft.com and search for the JetComp.exe utility, which will attempt to repair and compact your MDB without opening the file. The reason none of the suggestions above work is because they have to open the MDB to do their work, whereas JetComp doesn't open the file, but operates on it structurally. If it can't recover your file (which does happen), then you'll have to go to a data recovery service. I recommend Peter Miller of PKSolutions.com. -- David W. Fenton David Fenton Associates
144768 I have an opensource framework for working with CSV and flat files in general. Maybe it's worth looking: JFileHelpers. With that toolkit you can write code using beans, like: and then just parse your text files using: And you'll have a collection of parsed objects. Hope that helps!
144791 While the one class per file policy is strictly enforced in java, its not required by C#. However, its generally a good idea. I typically break this rule if I have a very small helper class that is only used by the main class, but I prefer to do that as a nested inner class for clarities sake. You can however, split a single class into multiple files using the partial keyword. This is useful for separating your code from wizard generated code.

152284 Yes, the most efficient way usually is searching in the database. To do that you have three alternatives: So it depends on what will you be actually searching for to decide what would be the best way. For books titles I'd offer a LIKE search for exact substrings useful when people know the book they're looking for and a FULLTEXT search to help find titles similar to a word or phrase. I'd give them different names of course (textual and similar or the like) An example about fulltext: http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2003/06/26/fulltext.html
152863 A TCP socket is an endpoint instance defined by an IP address and a port in the context of either a particular TCP connection or the listening state. A port is a virtualisation identifier defining a service endpoint (as distinct from a service instance endpoint aka session identifier). A TCP socket is not a connection, it is the endpoint of a specific connection. There can be concurrent connections to a service endpoint, because a connection is identified by both its local and remote endpoints, allowing traffic to be routed to a specific service instance. There can only be one listener socket for a given address/port combination. This was an interesting question that forced me to re-examine a number of things I thought I knew inside out. You'd think a name like "socket" would be self-explanatory: it was obviously chosen to evoke imagery of the endpoint into which you plug a network cable, there being strong functional parallels. Nevertheless, in network parlance the word "socket" carries so much baggage that a careful re-examination is necessary. In the broadest possible sense, a port is a point of ingress or egress. The French word porte literally means door. Ports, then, are transportation endpoints whether you ship data or big steel containers. For the purpose of this discussion I will limit consideration to the context of TCP-IP networks. The OSI model is all very well but has never been completely implemented, much less widely deployed in high-traffic high-stress conditions. The combination of an IP address and a port is strictly known as an endpoint and is sometimes called a socket. This usage originates with RFC793, the original TCP specification. A TCP connection is defined by two endpoints aka sockets. An endpoint (socket) is defined by the combination of a network address and a port identifier. Note that address/port does not completely identify a socket (more on this later). The purpose of ports is to differentiate multiple endpoints on a given network address. You could say that a port is a virtualised endpoint. This virtualisation makes multiple concurrent connections on a single network interface possible. It is the socket pair (the 4-tuple consisting of the client IP address, client port number, server IP address, and server port number) that specifies the two endpoints that uniquely identifies each TCP connection in an internet. (TCP-IP Illustrated Volume 1, W. Richard Stevens) In most C-derived lanaguages, TCP connections are established and manipulated using methods on an instance of a Socket class. Although it is common to operate on a higher level of abstraction, typically an instance of a NetworkStream class, this generally exposes a reference to a socket object. To the coder this socket object appears to represent the connection because the connection is created and manipulated using methods of the socket object. In C#, to establish a TCP connection (to an existing listener) first you create a TcpClient. If you don't specify an endpoint to the TcpClient constructor it uses defaults - one way or another the local endpoint is defined. Then you invoke the Connect method on the instance you've created. This method requires a parameter describing the other endpoint. All this is a bit confusing and leads you to believe that a socket is a connection, which is bollocks. I was labouring under this misapprehension until Richard Dorman asked the question. Having done a lot of reading and thinking, I'm now convinced that it would make a lot more sense to have a class TcpConnection with a constructor that takes two arguments, LocalEndpoint and RemoteEndpoint. You could probably support a single argument RemoteEndpoint when defaults are acceptable for the local endpoint. This is ambiguous on multihomed computers, but the ambiguity can be resolved using the routing table by selecting the interface with the shortest route to the remote endpoint. Clarity would be enhanced in other respects, too. A socket is not identified by the combination of IP address and port: [...]TCP demultiplexes incoming segments using all four values that comprise the local and foreign addresses: destination IP address, destination port number, source IP address, and source port number. TCP cannot determine which process gets an incoming segment by looking at the destination port only. Also, the only one of the [various] endpoints at [a given port number] that will receive incoming connection requests is the one in the listen state. (p255, TCP-IP Illustrated Volume 1, W. Richard Stevens) As you can see, it is not just possible but quite likely for a network service to have numerous sockets with the same address/port, but only one listener socket on a particular address/port combination. Use of a socket object as a proxy for a TCP connection is thus very misleading. TCP-IP Illustrated Volume 1 The Protocols, W. Richard Stevens, 1994 Addison Wesley RFC793, Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California for DARPA

154177 Python has an embedded GUI toolkit named TKinter which is based on Tk library from TCL programming language. It is very basic and does not have all the functionality you expect in Windows Forms or GTK for example but if you must have platform independent toolkit I see no other choice taking in mind that you also dont want to grow that much the binary. Tkinter is not hard at all to use since it doesnt have millions of widgets/controls and options and is the default toolkit included in most python distributions, at least on Windows, OSX and Linux. GTK and QT are prettier and more powerful but they have a one big disadvantage for you: they are heavy and deppend upon third libraries, especially GTK which has a lot of dependencies that makes it a little hard to distribute it embeded in your software. As for the binary creation I know there is py2exe which converts python code to win32 executable code (.exe's) but im not sure if there is something similar for OSX. Are you worried because people could see the source code or just so you can bundle all in a single package? If you just want to bundle everything you dont need to create a standalone executable, you could easily create an installer: Creating distributable in python That's a guide on how to distribute your software when it's done.
154195 I beg to differ, Wikipedia is pretty clear on this. In computer science, marshalling (similar to serialization) is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission. It is typically used when data must be moved between different parts of a computer program or from one program to another. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(computer_science)

155655 A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (ie. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed. A method is a piece of code that is called by name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences. (this is a simplified explanation, ignoring issues of scope etc.)

158657 Alternatively, for greater control over the HTTP request you can use WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1 in place of MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.
159099 In this case, "alternate" just means "previous". So, yes, :b2 (or 2 ctrl-6) is probably the easiest way to change which two buffers will be toggled by ctrl-6. Also, take a look at the :keepalt command.
161039 GotW #57 says to use a proxy class with an implicit conversion for this very purpose. This solution has three main strengths: It solves the problem as required. Better still, it's type-safe and portable. Its machinery is transparent: You get natural syntax for the caller/user, and natural syntax for the function's own "return stateA;" statement. It probably has zero overhead: On modern compilers, the proxy class, with its storage and functions, should inline and optimize away to nothing.
161362 Have you looked at PHP's filter_ functions? They're not perfect, but they do a fairly decent job in my experience. Example usage (returns boolean): filter_var($someEmail, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL);

Most of the time that I need to 'export' something from git, I want a compressed archive in any case so I do something like this. ZIP archive: git help archive for more details, it's quite flexible.
164447 Partly because the file systems expect NUL ('\0') bytes to terminate file names, so UTF-16 would not work well. You'd have to modify a lot of code to make that change.
164706 Value Types can't be null. It violates what it means to be a Value Type. You can wrap Value Types as Nullable(Of T) which gives you a great set of methods, and checks for Nothing do work. But you do have a lot of overhead with that wrapper. Perhaps you can clarify what you're trying to do? For completeness the VB syntax for Nullable wrappers is:
165472 Consistency. Code is more difficult to read if "foo", "Foo", "fOO", and "fOo" are considered to be identical. SOME PEOPLE WOULD WRITE EVERYTHING IN ALL CAPS, MAKING EVERYTHING LESS READABLE. Case sensitivity makes it easy to use the "same name" in different ways, according to a capitalization convention, e.g.,
165572 One thing that I have done in the past (in JavaScript not jQuery), in the above my JavaScript imports, is output the dynamic controls ID's similiar to what toohool recommends and assign them to variables that I reference in my script imports. Something like this, should allow you to take advantage of caching and still enable you to have the exact client IDs:
167555 Win32 does not guarantee atomic file meta data operations. I'd provide a citation, but there is none - that fact that there's no written or documented guarantee means as much. You're going to have to write your own routines to support this. It's unfortunate, but you can't expect win32 to provide this level of service - it simply wasn't designed for it. -Adam
169919 I recently needed to solve exactly this problem in an app. I ended up using this great little jQuery plugin to do the trick: WindowMsg (see link at bottom) While I'm sure there are other ways to accomplish the same task, that plugin does works thusly: In my experience working with the library, it would have also been quite nice if they had included the JSON 2 lib from JSON.org. Out of the box, WindowMsg only allows you to send string messages between windows, but with some pretty simple use of the JSON 2 lib, I was able to hack it to allow the sending of full JSON objects between windows. I bet more mature libraries (such as whatever google uses) include that kind of serialization and de-serialization baked in. I am putting this link here because for some reason, the Stack Overflow formatter turns it into an anchor link with no closing tag and I don't want my whole post to be one giant hyperlink!

169969 Use flock(1) to make an exclusive scoped lock a on file descriptor. This way you can even synchronize different parts of the script. This ensures that code between "(" and ")" is run only by one process at a time and that the process doesn't wait too long for a lock. Caveat: this particular command is a part of util-linux-ng. If you run an operating system other than Linux, it may or may not be available.

171779 To expand on what Shimi has said, you should only be running your loop from 1 to the square root of n. Then to find the pair, do n / i, and this will cover the whole problem space. As was also noted, this is a NP, or 'difficult' problem. Exhaustive search, the way you are doing it, is about as good as it gets for guaranteed answers. This fact is used by encryption algorithms and the like to help secure them. If someone were to solve this problem, most if not all of our current 'secure' communication would be rendered insecure. Python code: Which should output a list like:

173479 You have asked two questions that are not quite equivalent: Consider which of these behaviours you actually need. (It may be that either will do for your purposes.) The first question (simply checking that all keys are numeric) is answered well by Captain kurO. For the second question (checking whether the array is zero-indexed and sequential), you can use the following function:
175787 This works regardless of whether the variable contains is a string or number. Of course, you can negate this if you need to. For example, to implement the IsNumeric example you gave: only works if the string only contains numeric characters, else it returns NaN. useful for converting '12px' to 12, for example. Bear in mind that, unlike +num, parseInt (as the name suggests) will convert a float into an integer by chopping off everything following the decimal point (if you want to use parseInt() because of this behaviour, you're probably better off with Math.floor() instead): Empty strings may be a little counter-intuitive. +num converts empty strings to zero, and isNaN() assumes the same: But parseInt() does not agree:
176002 It depends on the object's implementation of .Equals(..).
176478 Use this instead: Once you declare foos as List<? extends Foo>, the compiler doesn't know that it's safe to add a SubFoo. What if an ArrayList<AltFoo> had been assigned to foos? That would be a valid assignment, but adding a SubFoo would pollute the collection.
177112 Make sure php_curl.dll is in the directory listed under "extension_dir" in php.ini. If it is already, try restarting IIS (Apache always needs a restart from me when making php.ini changes).

185900 Use a trap! ...then, whenever you create a temporary file: and $temp_foo will be deleted on exit, and the current line number will be printed. (set -e is always a good practice, and will likewise give you exit-on-error behavior). You can either let the trap call error for you (in which case it uses the default exit code of 1 and no message) or call it yourself and provide explicit values; for instance: will exit with status 2, and give an explicit message.
198459 HTML PHP php.ini Configuration When running this setup with larger files you may receive errors. Check your php.ini file for these keys: max_execution_time = 30 upload_max_filesize = 2M Increasing these values as appropriate may help. When using Apache, changes to this file require a restart. The maximum memory permitted value (set via memory_limit) does not play a role here as the file is written to the tmp directory as it is uploaded. The location of the tmp directory is optionally controlled via upload_tmp_dir.

199038 To my experience, when email providers check for spams, they check 5 main things other than content: (When I say domain, I'm referring to the domain of the sender's email address.) The fifth one is the one that was a problem for me. Apparently email providers such as Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo drop all incoming email from widely used server providers such as Amazon EC2. In that case, there's simply no way to guarantee the delivery of all outgoing emails, so you would have to relay all outgoing email from some other SMTP server outside the blacklisted segment. The easiest way to do this is configuring Postfix (or whatever MTA you're using) to automatically relay all emails. You can find plenty of articles on this if you do some googling. If that is not the case, then all you need is a simple MTA like Postfix, as long as all the necessary DNS records listed above are configured properly, you should have no trouble sending emails.
199133 In terms of business value, I would think it's extremely rare that a real case can be made for a rewrite due solely to the internal state of the code. If the product's customer-facing and is currently live and bringing in money (i.e. is not a mothballed or unreleased product), then consider that: In terms of technical reasons, I'd suggest it could be time for a major rewrite if the original has some technical dependencies that have become problematic. e.g. a third party dependency that's now out of support, etc. In general though, I think the most sensible move is to refactor piece by piece (very small pieces if it's really that bad), and improve the internal architecture incrementally rather than in one big drop.
199882 Floating containers, panels and dialogs: For dialog boxes and windows, perhaps a YUI module would be an easy solution. Modal Boxes If you aren't a javascript programmer, jQuery might be a practical option. There are jQuery plugins offering the modal lightbox effect. Sidenote: There are many libraries offering this kind of functionality, but if the box itself is the only piece you need, keep in consideration that some libraries will include many things you aren't using. If you're careful to use only the packages you need, you can keep your page nice and lean. Sidenote: If you're fairly well-versed with javascript, or wish to become so, remember that you can always write your own. It's common for people in the javascript world to turn straight to libraries. Libraries are an important part of the modern javascript landscape, but sometimes they become a crutch for developers. Writing a few front-end pieces yourself is a great way to dive into front-end development.
200103 I would suggest: The advantage of UTF-8 in storage and wire situations is that machine endianness is not a factor. The advantage of using a fixed size character such as wchar_t in code is that you can easily find out the length of a string without having to scan it.
200277 Patterns give you a small language to describe the structure of the values you want to match. The structure can be arbitrarily deep and you can bind variables to parts of the structured value. This allows you to write things extremely succinctly. You can illustrate this with a small example, such as a derivative function for a simple type of mathematical expressions: Additionally, because pattern matching is a static construct for static types, the compiler can (i) verify that you covered all cases (ii) detect redundant branches that can never match any value (iii) provide a very efficient implementation (with jumps etc.).
200981 One of the funnier things to discover: italics and bold text makrup does not work with CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) characters. They simply become unreadable. (OK, I couldn't really read them before either, but especially bolding just creates ink blots)
201378 There is no simple regular expression for this problem: see this fully RFCâ€‘822â€“compliant regex, which is anything but simple. (It was written before the days of grammatical patterns.) The grammar specified in RFC 5322 is too complicated for primitive regular expressions, although the more sophisticated grammatical patterns in Perl, PCRE, and PHP can all manage to correctly parse RFC 5322 without a hitch. Python and Câ™¯ should also be able to manage it, but they use a different syntax from those first three. However, if you are forced to use one of the many less powerful pattern-matching languages, then itâ€™s best to use a real parser. But understand that validating it per the RFC tells you absolutely nothing about whether the person entering the address is its true owner. People sign others up to mailing lists this way all the time. Fixing that requires a fancier kind of validation that involves sending that address a message that includes a confirmation token meant to be entered in the same web page as was the address. Thatâ€™s the only way to know you got the address of the person entering it, which is why most mailing lists now use that mechanism to confirm sign-ups. After all, anybody can put down president@whitehouse.gov, and that will even parse as legal, but it isnâ€™t likely to be the person at the other end. For PHP, you should not use the pattern given in Validate an E-Mail Address with PHP, the Right Way from which I quote "There is some danger that common usage and widespread sloppy coding will establish a de facto standard for e-mail addresses that is more restrictive than the recorded formal standard." That is no better than all the other non-RFC patterns. It isnâ€™t even smart enough to handle even RFC 822, let alone RFC 5322. This one, however, is. See also Validating Email Addresses, including the comments. Or Comparing E-mail Address Validating Regular Expressions.

204483 The return value for main should indicate how the program exited. Normal exit is generally represented by a 0 return value from main. Abnormal termination is usually signalled by a non-zero return but there is no standard for how non-zero codes are interpreted. Also as noted by others, void main() is explicitly prohibited by the C++ standard and shouldn't be used. The valid C++ main signatures are: and which is equivalent to It's also worth noting that in C++, int main() can be left without a return value at which point it defaults to returning 0. This is also true with a C99 program. Whether return 0 should be omitted or not is open to debate. The range of valid C program main signatures is much greater. Also, efficiency is not an issue with the main function. It can only be entered and left once (marking program start and termination) according to the C++ standard. For C, the case is different and re-entering main() is allowed, but should probably be avoided.
204777 I examined the methods of System.Linq.Enumerable, discarding any that returned non-IEnumerable results. I checked the remarks of each to determine how the order of the result would differ from order of the source. Preserves Order Absolutely. You can map a source element by index to a result element Preserves Order. Elements are filtered, but not re-ordered. Destroys Order - we don't know what order to expect results in. Redefines Order Explicitly - use these to change the order of the result Redefines Order according to some rules. Edit: I've moved Distinct to Preserving order based on this implementation.

206964 Unfortunately, at the moment, I don't think there is a "best" Python SOAP library. Each of the mainstream ones available has its own pros and cons. Older libraries: SOAPy: Was the "best," but no longer maintained. Does not work on Python 2.5+ ZSI: Very painful to use, and development is slow. Has a module called "SOAPpy", which is different than SOAPy (above). "Newer" libraries: SUDS: Very Pythonic, and easy to create WSDL-consuming SOAP clients. Creating SOAP servers is a little bit more difficult. (This package does not work with python3.) spyne: Creating servers is easy, creating clients a little bit more challenging. Documentation is somewhat lacking. ladon: Creating servers is much like in soaplib (using a decorator). Ladon exposes more interfaces than SOAP at the same time without extra user code needed. pysimplesoap: very lightweight but useful for both client and server - includes a web2py server integration that ships with web2py. SOAPpy: Distinct from the abandoned SOAPpy that's hosted at the ZSI link above, this version was actually maintained until 2011, now it seems to be abandoned too. soaplib: Easy to use python library for writing and calling soap web services. Webservices written with soaplib are simple, lightweight, work well with other SOAP implementations, and can be deployed as WSGI applications. osa: A fast/slim easy to use SOAP python client library. Of the above, I've only used SUDS personally, and I liked it a lot. Update: Additionally to what is mentioned above, I will refer to Python WebServices page which is always up-to-date with all actively maintained and recommended modules to SOAP and all other webservice types. Update (2016): If you only need SOAP client, there is well maintained library called zeep. It supports both Python 2 and 3 :)

209703 You either do what you've already got, pass in a delimited string and then parse out to a table value, or the other choice is passing in a wodge of XML and kinda much the same: http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2007/02/16/passing-lists-to-sql-server-2005-with-xml-parameters.aspx I haven't had a chance to look ate SQL 2008 yet to see if they've added any new functionality to handle this type of thing.
210850 NP stands for Non-deterministic Polynomial time. This means that the problem can be solved in Polynomial time using a Non-deterministic Turing machine (like a regular Turing machine but also including a non-deterministic "choice" function). Basically, a solution has to be testable in poly time. If that's the case, and a known NP problem can be solved using the given problem with modified input (an NP problem can be reduced to the given problem) then the problem is NP complete. The main thing to take away from an NP-complete problem is that it cannot be solved in polynomial time in any known way. NP-Hard/NP-Complete is a way of showing that certain classes of problems are not solvable in realistic time. Edit: As others have noted, there are often approximation solutions for NP-Complete problems. In this case, the approximation solution usually gives a approximation bound using special notation which tells us how close the approximation is.

213531 For me, it's simple: I work 8 hours a day already. I spend a few more hours a day keeping current. I have a girlfriend, some local family and a decent circle of friends. I have (gasp) non-computer-related interests and hobbies. In other words, I have a life. So ... Time. Time is not on my side. Would that it was ... My blog might be a bit more current if there were just two more hours in every day. :) (Originally posted by John Rudy.)
214717 As the maintainer of ExtUtils::MakeMaker, I like to recommend Module::Build because MakeMaker is a horror show and I don't want to maintain it any more. Module::Build is so much better put together. But those aren't your concerns and I'll present my "least hassle for you" answer. Because Module::Build support is not 100% in place through all of Perl, start with MakeMaker. If you want to do any customization at all, switch to Module::Build. Since their basic layout, options and interface are almost identical this will be painless. As seductive as it looks, avoid Module::Install. Fortunately, Module::Build can emulate MakeMaker which helps some, but doesn't help if you're going to do any customization. See Module::Build::Compat. For CPAN releases using Module::Build is fine. There's enough Module::Build stuff on CPAN now that everyone's dealt with getting it bootstrapped already. Finally, the new configure_requires option lets CPAN shells know to install Module::Build before they can start building the module. Unfortunately only the latest CPAN shells know about configure_requires. Oh, whatever you do don't use h2xs (unless you're writing XS code... and even then think about it).
214758 Parameters and local variables are allocated on the stack (with reference types the object lives on the heap and a variable references that object). The stack typically lives at the upper end of your address space and as it is used up it heads towards the bottom of the address space (i.e. towards zero). Your process also has a heap, which lives at the bottom end of your process. As you allocate memory, this heap can grow towards the upper end of your address space. As you can see, there is a potential for the heap to "collide" with the stack (a bit like tectonic plates!!!). The common cause for a stack overflow is a bad recursive call. Typically, this is caused when your recursive functions doesn't have the correct termination condition, so it ends up calling itself forever. However, with GUI programming, it's possible to generate indirect recursion. For example, your app may be handling paint messages, and, whilst processing them, it may call a function that causes the system to send another paint message. Here you've not explicitly called yourself, but the OS/VM has done it for you. To deal with them you'll need to examine your code. If you've got functions that call themselves then check that you've got a terminating condition. If you have then check than when calling the function you have at least modified one of the arguments, otherwise there'll be no visible change for the recursively called function and the terminating condition is useless. If you've got no obvious recursive functions then check to see if you're calling any library functions that indirectly will cause your function to be called (like the implicit case above).
215153 Predicate<T> is a delegate type. You can never derive from delegates. To be honest, it doesn't sound like inheritance is really appropriate here anyway - just write a method which returns an inverse of the original. It's as simple as this:
215244 Use the List functions to your advantage. Be aware that this only works for file names that actually have a file extension (that is defined as the thing after the last dot). To make it safer, the following is better: To complicate things a bit further: There may be files that start with a dot. There may be file names that contain many adjacent dots. List functions return wrong results for them, as they ignore empty list elements. There may also be files that have dots, but no extension. These can only be handled if you provide an extension white list: ListFindNoCase(FileExt, "doc,xls,ppt,jpg"). If you want to account for all of this, you probably need to resign to a reguar expression: To split file name from path, ColdFusion provides distinct functions that also handle platform differences: GetFileFromPath() and GetDirectoryFromPath()
215422 Just for the sake of completeness, here's a brain dump of related information... As others have noted, string is an alias for System.String. They compile to the same code, so at execution time there is no difference whatsoever. This is just one of the aliases in C#. The complete list is: Apart from string, object, the aliases are all to value types. decimal is a value type, but not a primitive type in the CLR. The only primitive type which doesn't have an alias is System.IntPtr. In the spec, the value type aliases are known as "simple types". Literals can be used for constant values of every simple type; no other value types have literal forms available. (Compare this with VB, which allows DateTime literals, and has an alias for it too.) There is one circumstance in which you have to use the aliases: when explicitly specifying an enum's underlying type. For instance: Finally, when it comes to which to use: personally I use the aliases everywhere for the implementation, but the CLR type for any APIs. It really doesn't matter too much which you use in terms of implementation - consistency among your team is nice, but no-one else is going to care. On the other hand, it's genuinely important that if you refer to a type in an API, you do so in a language neutral way. A method called "ReadInt32" is unambiguous, whereas a method called "ReadInt" requires interpretation. The caller could be using a language which defines an "int" alias for Int16, for example. The .NET framework designers have followed this pattern, good examples being in the BitConverter, BinaryReader and Convert classes.
215462 Designs like MVP and MVC typically try to abstract as much logic out of the actual GUI as possible. One very popular article about this is "The Humble Dialog Box" by Michael Feathers. Personally I've had mixed experiences with trying to move logic out of the UI - sometimes it's worked very well, and at other times it's been more trouble than it's worth. It's somewhat outside my area of expertise though.

215731 Assuming the commit you want is abcde: The git checkout man page gives more information. As a side note, I've always been uncomfortable with this command because it's used for both ordinary things (changing between branches) and unusual destructive things (discarding changes in the working directory).
216075 The display looks interesting, because a binary file can contain non-printable characters. It is up to the displaying program to replace such characters with something else. This can be prevented by using a hex editor. Such a program displays each byte from the file as its hexadecimal value. That makes for a nice tabular view of the file, but it is not easy for the average person to decipher this view, because we are not used to look at data that way. There are a few ways to find out what program a file might belong to. You can look at the beginning of the file and with some knowledge, you might recognize the file type. There are some types that begin with the same characters (RAR, GIF etc.). For other types it might not be as easy. In Linux you can use the "file" command to help you determine file type. There are probably programs for Windows that will do the same.
216214 I would recommend a look at jQuery for your task. It is quite easy to learn and produces nice effects quickly. But your described effect alone, pure JavaScript would also be enough. Make your DIVs always have a class called "selectable". You can toggle other CSS classes later on. Create a CSS class named "selected" and give it the desired look. Then add something like this to the scripts section of your document: This is untested so there might be a glitch in it, but it will give you the general idea where to start. P.S: Changing text size on mouse move may not be the best of all ideas. It leads to rearranging the page layout which is annoying for the user.
216266 There are two limits, both not enforced by C++ but rather by the hardware. The first limit (should never be reached) is set by the restrictions of the size type used to describe an index in the array (and the size thereof). It is given by the maximum value the system's std::size_t can take. This data type should always be the largest integer type of a system. The other limit is a physical memory limit. The larger your objects in the array are, the sooner this limit is reached because memory is full. For example, a vector<int> of a given size n typically takes about four times as much memory as an array of type vector<char> (minus a small constant value). Therefore, a vector<char> may contain more items than a vector<int> before memory is full. The same counts for the native C-style arrays int[] and char[]. Additionally, this upper limit may be influenced by the type of allocator used to construct the vector because an allocator is free to manage memory any way it wants. A very odd but nontheless conceivable allocator could pool memory in such a way that identical instances of an object share resources. This way, you could insert a lot of identical objects into a container that would otherwise use up all the available memory. Apart from that, C++ doesn't enforce any limits.

218390 They're exceptions that occur when you try to use a reference that points to no location in memory (null) as though it were referencing an object. Calling a method on a null reference or trying to access a field of a null reference will trigger a NPE. These are the most common, but other ways are listed on the NullPointerException javadoc page. Probably the quickest example code I could come up with to illustrate a NPE would be: On the first line inside main I'm explicitly setting the Object reference obj to null. This means I have a reference, but it isn't pointing to any object. After that, I try to treat the reference as though it points to an object by calling a method on it. This results in a NPE because there is no code to execute in the location that the reference is pointing. (This is a technicality, but I think it bears mentioning: A reference that points to null isn't the same as a C pointer that points to an invalid memory location. A null pointer is literally not pointing anywhere, which is subtly different than pointing to a location that happens to be invalid.)
218408 A NULL pointer is one that points to nowhere. When you dereference a pointer "p", you say "give me the data at the location stored in "p". When p is a null pointer, the location stored in "p" is "nowhere", you're saying "give me the data at the location 'nowhere'". Obviously it can't do this, so it throws a NULL pointer exception. In general, it's because something hasn't been initialized properly.
218419 In .Net 4, there's a new overload for string.Join that accepts IEnumerable<string>. The code would then look like:
218437 I have only code.
218510 When you declare a reference variable (i.e. an object) you are really creating a pointer to an object. Consider the following code where you declare a variable of primitive type int: In this example, the variable x is an int and Java will initialize it to 0 for you. When you assign it the value of 10 on the second line, your value of 10 is written into the memory location referred to by x. But, when you try to declare a reference type, something different happens. Take the following code: The first line declares a variable named num, but it does not actually contain a primitive value yet. Instead, it contains a pointer (because the type is Integer which is a reference type). Since you have not yet said what to point to, Java sets it to null, which means "I am pointing to nothing". In the second line, the new keyword is used to instantiate (or create) an object of type Integer and the pointer variable num is assigned to that Integer object. The NullPointerException occurs when you declare a variable but did not create an object. So you are pointing to something that does not actually exist. If you attempt to dereference num BEFORE creating the object you get a NullPointerException. In the most trivial cases, the compiler will catch the problem and let you know that "num may not have been initialized," but sometimes you may write code that does not directly create the object. For instance, you may have a method as follows: In which case, you are not creating the object obj, but rather assuming that it was created before the doSomething() method was called. Note, it is possible to call the method like this: In which case, obj is null. If the method is intended to do something to the passed-in object, it is appropriate to throw the NullPointerException because it's a programmer error and the programmer will need that information for debugging purposes. Alternatively, there may be cases where the purpose of the method is not solely to operate on the passed in object, and therefore a null parameter may be acceptable. In this case, you would need to check for a null parameter and behave differently. You should also explain this in the documentation. For example, doSomething() could be written as: Finally, How to pinpoint the exception & cause using Stack Trace
219605 A slightly better way than counting the characters, is to use information schema.routines. You could sum the length of each Routine Definition as (Note each routine definition will max out at 4,000 characters, see below for a method that doesn't have this restriction): Or you could return the length of each sp It's unlikely that the length of your stored procedures is the problem. Usually running out of space with a database is due to things like not backing up the log file (and then shrinking it using dbcc shrinkfile or dbcc shrinkdatabase). In Sql 2000, here is a routine that would provide the length without the 4000 character limit of above:
219801 If you're using Java 6 (which you should be), Sun added classpath wildcards but you have to get the syntax JUST right. See Classpath. Jump down to the section, "Understanding class path wildcards" (about midway down the page)
219855 reverse indentation. For example: and:
219891 In the latter case, if obj is null you won't get a NullPointerException but a false.
219998 In general, use the instanceof operator to test whether an object is an array. At the JVM level, the instanceof operator translates to a specific "instanceof" byte code, which is highly optimized in most JVM implementations. The reflective approach (getClass().isArray()) is compiled to two separate "invokevirtual" instructions. The more generic optimizations applied by the JVM to these may not be as fast as the hand-tuned optimizations inherent in the "instanceof" instruction. There are two special cases: null references and references to primitive arrays. A null reference will cause instanceof to result false, while the isArray throws a NullPointerException. Applied to a primitive array, the instanceof results false, but the isArray returns true.
220991 If you are looking for real world implemention in .NET, there is .NET URL Rewriter, a free open-source component for IIS/ASP.NET. As the name suggests, it's an URL rewriting component, but it has also reverse proxying capabilities. With a simple line like this in the configuration file you could easily distribute sites to internal or external locations. UrlRewriter.NET is an open-source, light-weight, highly configurable URL rewriting component for ASP.NET 1.1 and 2.0. UrlRewriter.NET provides similar IIS Rewrite capabilities that the Apache web server provides with mod_rewrite and .htaccess. You donâ€™t need to install an ISAPI Rewrite filter to use the component. Best of all, UrlRewriter.NET is free and licensed with a very permissive MIT-style licence.
221257 If it is a simple single source program: where the source file is foo.c or foo.cpp, etc. You dont even need a makefile. Make has enough built-in rules to build your source file into an executable of the same name, minus extension. Running the executable just built is the same as running any program - but you will most often need to specify the path to the executable as the shell will only search what is in $PATH to find executables, and most often that does not include the current directory (.). So to run the built executable foo:
222902 It would take me a lot of convincing to switch from perforce. In the two companies I used it it was more than adequate. Those were both companies with disparate offices, but the offices were set up with plenty of infrastructure so there was no need to have the disjoint/disconnected features. How many developers are you talking about changing over? The real question is - what is it about perforce that is not meeting your organization's needs that git can provide? And similarly, what weaknesses does git have compared to perforce? If you can't answer that yourself then asking here won't help. You need to find a business case for your company. (e.g. Perhaps it is with lower overall cost of ownership (that includes loss of productivity for the interim learning stage, higher admin costs (at least initially), etc.) I think you are in for a tough sell - perforce is a pretty good one to try to replace. It is a no brainer if you are trying to boot out pvcs or ssafe.

224353 There's no definitive right way, because so many people are doing so many different things.. Crockford suggests that you "go with the grain", or write javascript in a way that corresponds to javascript's prototypal nature. Of course, he goes on to show that the original model that Netscape suggested is actually broken. He labels it "pseudoclassical", and points out a lot of the misdirection and unnecessary complexity that is involved in following that model. He wrote the "object" function as a remedy (now known as Object.create() ). It allows for some very powerful prototypal patterns. It's not always easy to do develop a clean interface when you have to work with legacy javascript, especially not when you're dealing with large systems which usually include multiple libraries, each implementing a different pattern. In general, I'd say that the "right way" is the one which allows you to write a clean interface which behaves well in the context of your legacy code, but also allows you to refactor and eliminate old dependencies over time. Considering the differences between the major library patterns, I've found that the most successful route to take in my own work is to keep my interfaces independent of the libraries entirely. I'll use a library or module if it's helpful, but won't be bound to it. This has allowed me to refactor a lot of code, phase out some libraries, and use libraries as scaffolding which can be optimized later. Along these lines, I've written interfaces that were inspired by Crockford's parasitic inheritance pattern. It's really a win for simplicity. On the other side of the coin, I'm sure you could argue for picking a library, enforcing it across your team, and conforming to both its inheritance patterns and its interface conventions.
225983 I wrote this thinking you were talking about WPF, rather than Silverlight, but there may be enough overlap for this to be helpful, so I'm posting it, anyway. If by "change the appearance of the base class" you mean "provide a new template", then what you need is probably a CustomControl not a UserControl. The best way to accomplish this is to follow the example set by other Microsoft controls, such as Button or ListBox: This is certainly much more work than simply deriving from UserControl, but if you want to be able to totally re-template controls, like you can with the built-in controls, this is the way to do it. On the other hand, if all you want to do is to provide a certain amount of limited customization, such as changing the background, or associating a Command with some user action, then the best thing to do is to expose DependencyProperties, which can then be set in styles for your control, or on instances of your control, itself. In the case you mentioned of wanting to customize the look in an inherited control, the process is pretty similar: just add a default style for the new control with a new template; if you need to add more event handlers, just be absolutely certain that you call base.OnApplyTemplate().

228734 Something like this? (I don't speak Python; please forgive my syntax errors)
228757 ###if this structure is to be used by some other file func.c how to do it? When a type is used in a file (i.e. func.c file), it must be visible. The very worst way to do it is copy paste it in each source file needed it. The right way is putting it in an header file, and include this header file whenever needed. ###shall we open a new header file and declare the structure there and include that header in the func.c? This is the solution I like more, because it makes the code highly modular. I would code your struct as: I would put functions using this structure in the same header (the function that are "semantically" part of its "interface"). And usually, I could name the file after the structure name, and use that name again to choose the header guards defines. If you need to declare a function using a pointer to the struct, you won't need the full struct definition. A simple forward declaration like: Will be enough, and it decreases coupling. ###or can we define the total structure in header file and include that in both source.c and func.c? This is another way, easier somewhat, but less modular: Some code needing only your structure to work would still have to include all types. In C++, this could lead to interesting complication, but this is out of topic (no C++ tag), so I won't elaborate. ###then how to declare that structure as extern in both the files. ? I fail to see the point, perhaps, but Greg Hewgill has a very good answer in his post How to declare a structure in a header that is to be used by multiple files in c?. ###shall we typedef it then how? The reason being that C struct managing can be a pain: You have to declare the struct keyword everywhere it is used: While a typedef will enable you to write it without the struct keyword. It is important you still keep a name for the struct. Writing: will just create an anonymous struct with a typedef-ed name, and you won't be able to forward-declare it. So keep to the following format: Thus, you'll be able to use MyStruct everywhere you want to avoid adding the struct keyword, and still use MyStructTag when a typedef won't work (i.e. forward declaration) ###Edit: Corrected wrong assumption about C99 struct declaration, as rightfully remarked by Jonathan Leffler.
229567 I want to make sure this is out there, because it's so hard to get right:
229658 If you can identify what is to be replaced through a regular expression, I recommend using the optional task replaceregexp. Here's the doc: http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/replaceregexp.html You can call it twice, one for the start tag and other for the end tag. The regexp for replacing your can be a bit cumbersome, since you say you do not want to replace all tags, but I think this is the easiest way. Another option would be to create a custom ant task to do what you want.
260277 Skip lists are more amenable to concurrent access/modification. Herb Sutter wrote an article about data structure in concurrent environments. It has more indepth information. Update from Jon Harrops comments I read Fraser and Harris's latest paper Concurrent programming without locks. Really good stuff if you're interested in lock-free data structures. The paper focuses on Transactional Memory and a theoretical operation multiword-compare-and-swap MCAS. Both of these are simulated in software as no hardware supports them yet. I'm fairly impressed that they were able to build MCAS in software at all. I didn't find the transactional memory stuff particularly compelling as it requires a garbage collector. Also software transactional memory is plagued with performance issues. However, I'd be very excited if hardware transactional memory ever becomes common. In the end it's still research and won't be of use for production code for another decade or so. In section 8.2 they compare the performance of several concurrent tree implementations. I'll summarize their findings. It's worth it to download the pdf as it has some very informative graphs on pages 50, 53, and 54.
260433 Here's an answer like MizardX's, but without its apparent problem of taking quadratic time in the worst case from rescanning the working string repeatedly for newlines as chunks are added. Compared to the activestate solution (which also seems to be quadratic), this doesn't blow up given an empty file, and does one seek per block read instead of two. Compared to spawning 'tail', this is self-contained. (But 'tail' is best if you have it.) Compared to grabbing a few kB off the end and hoping it's enough, this works for any line length. To use it as requested: Edit: changed map() to itertools.imap() in head(). Edit 2: simplified reversed_blocks(). Edit 3: avoid rescanning tail for newlines.
263416 I usually go with something like the implementation given in Josh Bloch's fabulous Effective Java. It's fast and creates a pretty good hash which is unlikely to cause collisions. Pick two different prime numbers, e.g. 17 and 23, and do:
264603 If I understood your question correctly, you have known data structure and you are modifying data - not XML structure of file. Under these condition and if performance is crucial, then you could try with direct text manipulation - skip XML parsing. Read from stream, use some fast text search algorithm e.g. Boyer-Moore, to find places where you need to modify data, do your modification and output data into another stream. This would be one-pass, no XML parsing, no in-memory XML tree building.
264706 Don't know if this works, but why don't you try counter(page+1)?

However getifaddress() will let you do the same thing easily, it works fine for me on os x 10.5 and should be the same below. I've done a quick example below which will print all of the machine's IPv4 address, (you should also check the getifaddrs was successful ie returns 0). I've updated it show IPv6 addresses too.

270632 Could you use a recursive version of ldd for this? Someone seems to have written a script that might help. This at least tell you that all the dependency libs could be resolved, if they were specified in the .so correctly in the first place. You can guarantee that all the dependencies are referenced in the .so with linker options, and this plus recursive ldd would guarantee you no unresolved symbols.
271104 Why does everybody want to return a singleton as a pointer? Return it as a reference seems much more logical! You should never be able to free a singleton manually. How do you know who is keeping a reference to the singleton? If you don't know (or can't guarantee) nobody has a reference (in your case via a pointer) then you have no business freeing the object. Use the static in a function method. This guarantees that it is created and destroyed only once. It also gives you lazy initialization for free. Note you also need to make the constructor private. Also make sure that you override the default copy constructor and assignment operator so that you can not make a copy of the singleton (otherwise it would not be a singleton). Also read: To make sure you are using a singleton for the correct reasons. Though technically not thread safe in the general case see: What is the lifetime of a static variable in a C++ function?

272688 protected is the correct approach here. But in another situation, you may wish to use editorbrowsableattribute which will hide the method from intellisense. You can still call it, but it slows down devs from calling something that could blow up the program, and will usually force them to read your giant comment-warnings.
272747 I'd recommend throwing a RuntimeException from ServletContextListener.contextInitialized. Servlet 2.3 wasn't very clear on this, but Servlet 2.4 added the following detail: Some exceptions do not occur under the call stack of another component in the application. An example of this is a â€¦ ServletContextListener that throws an unhandled exception during a notification of servlet context initializationâ€¦. In this case, the Developer has no opportunity to handle the exception. The container may respond to all subsequent requests to the Web application with an HTTP status code 500 to indicate an application error. Since it says that the servlet engine "may" disable access to application, you might find a server that does something else. However, Tomcat and WebLogic both disable the application, and the only other reasonable thing I can think of would be to ignore the exception. I can't see a container that did that being very popularâ€”so you'd better test it in WebSphere yourself.
272841 When I'm writing a class, most methods fall into two categories: Static methods are useful, because just by looking at its signature, you know that the calling it doesn't use or modify the current instance's state. Take this example: If an instance of library's state ever gets screwed up, and I'm trying to figure out why, I can rule out findBook as the culprit, just from its signature. I try to communicate as much as I can with a method or function's signature, and this is an excellent way to do that.
273227 I see two answers with good qualities, each with a small flaw, so I will give my take on it: Try os.path.exists, and consider os.makedirs for the creation. As noted in comments and elsewhere, there's a race condition - if the directory is created between the os.path.exists and the os.makedirs calls, the os.makedirs will fail with an OSError. Unfortunately, blanket-catching OSError and continuing is not foolproof, as it will ignore a failure to create the directory due to other factors, such as insufficient permissions, full disk, etc. One option would be to trap the OSError and examine the embedded error code, if one knew what's what (on my OS, 13 seems to indicate that permission is denied, and 17 that the file exists - it's not clear that that's even remotely portable, but is explored in Is there a cross-platform way of getting information from Pythonâ€™s OSError). Alternatively, there could be a second os.path.exists, but suppose another created the directory after the first check, then removed it before the second one - we could still be fooled. Depending on the application, the danger of concurrent operations may be more or less than the danger posed by other factors such as file permissions. The developer would have to know more about the particular application being developed and its expected environment before choosing an implementation.

274294 In a comment, lamcro observes in regard to the question of whether or not a comb box box has a Recordset: When I break into the forms VB code and "Add Watch" the CB control, the recordset property is in there. I can even enter and see it's own properties. I see it when I set a watch list, but the recordset of a combo box is not accessible or alterable via code. In order to filter a combo box, you need to work with its Rowsource. This can be accomplished one of two ways: Say you have cmbComboBox1 and when you select a value in it, you want the values listed in cmbCombBox2 to be filtered according to the value selected in cmbComboBox1. For method 1, you'd use the first combo box's AfterUpdate to set the rowsource of the second: To use the second method, you'd instead define the Rowsource of the second combo box to be based on testing the value of the first: What this does is filter the rowsource if the first combo box has a value and doesn't filter it if there is a value. That is, you get an unfiltered list until there's a value chosen for the first combo box. Then, in the Afterupdate event of cmbComboBox1, you'd requery the second combo box: It's also probably a good idea to define a parameter in order to insure that the reference to the form control gets appropriately resolved, so your Rowsource would be this: (assuming you're filtering on an Autonumber PK -- if the data type is different, you'd use a different data type, of course) I would tend to use the dynamic Rowsource assignment, simply because I've found it to be less problematic across different Access versions (i.e., references to controls on forms are not resolved the same way in all versions of Access). -- David W.

275031 With that level of accuracy, it would be better to reason in CPU tick rather than in system call like clock(). And do not forget that if it takes more than one nanosecond to execute an instruction... having a nanosecond accuracy is pretty much impossible. Still, something like that is a start: Here's the actual code to retrieve number of 80x86 CPU clock ticks passed since the CPU was last started. It will work on Pentium and above (386/486 not supported). This code is actually MS Visual C++ specific, but can be probably very easy ported to whatever else, as long as it supports inline assembly. This function has also the advantage of being extremely fast - it usually takes no more than 50 cpu cycles to execute. Using the Timing Figures: If you need to translate the clock counts into true elapsed time, divide the results by your chip's clock speed. Remember that the "rated" GHz is likely to be slightly different from the actual speed of your chip. To check your chip's true speed, you can use several very good utilities or the Win32 call, QueryPerformanceFrequency().
275091 Yes, you can. Just copy the binary and off you go.
275293 shared_ptr and weak_ptr, especially in multithreaded code, are alone worth installing boost. BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT is also pretty cool for doing compile-time logic checking. The fact that a lot of the classes and utilities in boost are in headers, meaning you can get a lot of functionality without having to compile anything at all, is also a plus. Portability usually isn't a problem, unless you use an extremely old compiler. I once tried to get MPL to work with VC6 and it printed out 40,000 warnings/internal errors before exploding completely. But in general most of the library should work regardless of your platform or compiler vendor. Take into consideration the fact that quite a few things from Boost are already in TR1, and will most likely be in the next revision of the C++ standard library. That's a pretty big endorsement.

275875 with regards to 'describe-last-function': There's a variable last-command which is set to a symbol representative of the last thing you did. So this elisp snippet - (descibe-function last-command) - ought to bring up the documentation for the thing that immediately happened. So you could make a trivial working describe-last-function like so Put that elisp in .emacs or equivalent, and you'll have a M-x describe-last-function. If you've banged on a few keys or done something that modified last-command since the thing you're interested in, the command-history function might be of interest.

279537 Immutable objects are objects that can't be changed programmatically. They're especially good for multi-threaded environments or other environments where more than one process is able to alter (mutate) the values in an object. Just to clarify, however, StringBuilder is actually a mutable object, not an immutable one. A regular java String is immutable (meaning that once it's been created you cannot change the underlying string without changing the object). For example, let's say that I have a class called ColoredString that has a String value and a String color: In this example, the ColoredString is said to be mutable because you can change (mutate) one of its key properties without creating a new ColoredString class. The reason why this may be bad is, for example, let's say you have a GUI application which has multiple threads and you are using ColoredStrings to print data to the window. If you have an instance of ColoredString which was created as Then you would expect the string to always be "Blue". If another thread, however, got ahold of this instance and called You would suddenly, and probably unexpectedly, now have a "Red" string when you wanted a "Blue" one. Because of this, immutable objects are almost always preferred when passing instances of objects around. When you have a case where mutable objects are really necessary, then you would typically guard the objet by only passing copies out from your specific field of control. To recap, in Java, java.lang.String is an immutable object (it cannot be changed once it's created) and java.lang.StringBuilder is a mutable object because it can be changed without creating a new instance.
280121 Wikipedia points to the term [Canonicalization][1]. A process for converting data that has more than one possible representation into a "standard" canonical representation. This can be done to compare different representations for equivalence, to count the number of distinct data structures, to improve the efficiency of various algorithms by eliminating repeated calculations, or to make it possible to impose a meaningful sorting order. The Unicode example made the most sense to me: Variable-length encodings in the Unicode standard, in particular UTF-8, have more than one possible encoding for most common characters. This makes string validation more complicated, since every possible encoding of each string character must be considered. A software implementation which does not consider all character encodings runs the risk of accepting strings considered invalid in the application design, which could cause bugs or allow attacks. The solution is to allow a single encoding for each character. Canonicalization is then the process of translating every string character to its single allowed encoding. An alternative is for software to determine whether a string is canonicalized, and then reject it if it is not. In this case, in a client/server context, the canonicalization would be the responsibility of the client. In summary, a standard form of representation for data. From this form you can then convert to any representation you may need. Brian G. [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonicalization

282495 If you think about it, the auto-increment number should not be transactional. If other transactions had to wait to see if the auto-number was going to be used or "rolled back", they would be blocked by the existing transaction using the auto-number. For example, consider my psuedo code below with table A using an auto-number field for the ID column: If user 2's transaction starts a millisecond after user 1's, then their insert into table A would have to wait for user 1's entire transaction to complete just to see if the auto-number from the first insert into A was used. This is a feature, not a bug. I would recommend using another scheme to generate auto-numbers if you need them to be tightly sequential.

286978 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language. An object is an unordered set of name/value pairs. An object begins with { (left brace) and ends with } (right brace). Each name is followed by : (colon) and the name/value pairs are separated by , (comma). alt text http://www.json.org/object.gif An array is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with [ (left bracket) and ends with ] (right bracket). Values are separated by , (comma). alt text http://www.json.org/array.gif A value can be a string in double quotes, or a number, or true or false or null, or an object or an array. These structures can be nested. alt text http://www.json.org/value.gif A string is a collection of zero or more Unicode characters, wrapped in double quotes, using backslash escapes. A character is represented as a single character string. A string is very much like a C or Java string. alt text http://www.json.org/string.gif A number is very much like a C or Java number, except that the octal and hexadecimal formats are not used. alt text http://www.json.org/number.gif You can get more information at json.org Here is an example: And in XML the same thing would have been: Hope you now get an idea of what is JSON.

289759 According to the MySQL manual you can use bool and boolean which are at the moment aliases of tinyint(1): Bool, Boolean: These types are synonyms for TINYINT(1). A value of zero is considered false. Non-zero values are considered true. MySQL also states that: We intend to implement full boolean type handling, in accordance with standard SQL, in a future MySQL release. BTW: this is just a matter of http://www.google.ch/search?q=mysql+boolean+datatype.

316217 Um, what are you trying to do? Why are you using parameters? Why not just execute SQL in code, like this: I don't use parameters in saved queries except when I need to pull a value from a control on a form to be used in a saved query. Now, my answer might not be good if your back end is not Jet or if there's something about the actual criteria and structure of your saved query that makes it important to use a saved query instead of simply using on-the-fly SQL. But you've provided virtually no information (including omitting the SQL of the querydef you're executing), so it's rather difficult to supply any kind of helpful answer. -- David W.

316778 My recommended way of storing %age based rates/interest is: You should have a table 'VAT_param' like Interest rate | Effective from (date) | Effective Till(date) I believe, "Anything that can be calculated, should not be saved" Especially in such cases where you need to calculate values based on %age of others (like taxes, interest, etc.) DOnt let the Time-Space tradeoff dodge you. You'll bless yourself later for spending time over space. Then the VAT should be neatly calculated based on the effective rate during the period, based on the Invoice date. It will Ensure least redundancy (pls. never talk about old tables or new tables.. over a few years you'll start pulling your hairs if the interest rate changes once an year) Have a centralised single-pivot to control the rate.

320878 Yes, I did use the MapVirtualKey method. But I was expecting more details on how to use it: what DllImport directive to use, what enum is specific for mapping to characters, etc. I don't like these answers where you google for like 5 seconds and then just suggest a solution: the real challenge is to put all the pieces together and not have to waste your time with tons of sample-less MSDN pages or other coding forums in order to get your answer.

321444 [Option 2 is] NOT the most normalized option [as @Ray claims]. The most normalized would have no nullable fields and obviously option 2 would require a null on every row. At this point in your design you have to think about the usage, the queries you'll do, the reports you'll write. Will you want to do math on all of the numeric responses at the same time? i.e. WHERE numeric_response IS NOT NULL? Probably unlikely. More likely would be, What's the average response WHERE Question = 11. In those cases you can either choose the INT table or the INT column and neither would be easier to do than the other. If you did do two tables, you'd more than likely be constantly unioning them together for questions like, what % of questions have a response etc. Can you see how the questions you ask your database to answer start to drive the design?
325063 Note you can convert any number to a string by simply doing "" + number too. If you have many strings, consider using a string builder, as that's faster and won't update the GUI element multiple times: (also fixes the initial ", " before the first item, which happens above)

326440 Here's a compact, robust idiom for Java 7, wrapped up in a utility method: Java 7 added a convenience method to read a file as lines of text, represented as a List<String>. This approach is "lossy" because the line separators are stripped from the end of each line. The first method, that preserves line breaks, can temporarily require memory several times the size of the file, because for a short time the raw file contents (a byte array), and the decoded characters (each of which is 16 bits even if encoded as 8 bits in the file) reside in memory at once. It is safest to apply to files that you know to be small relative to the available memory. The second method, reading lines, is usually more memory efficient, because the input byte buffer for decoding doesn't need to contain the entire file. However, it's still not suitable for files that are very large relative to available memory. For reading large files, you need a different design for your program, one that reads a chunk of text from a stream, processes it, and then moves on to the next, reusing the same fixed-sized memory block. Here, "large" depends on the computer specs. Nowadays, this threshold might be many gigabytes of RAM. One thing that is missing from the sample in the original post is the character encoding. There are some special cases where the platform default is what you want, but they are rare, and you should be able justify your choice. The StandardCharsets class define some constants for the encodings required of all Java runtimes: The platform default is available from the Charset class itself: Note: This answer largely replaces my Java 6 version. The utility of Java 7 safely simplifies the code, and the old answer, which used a mapped byte buffer, prevented the file that was read from being deleted until the mapped buffer was garbage collected. You can view the old version via the "edited" link on this answer.
326612 There is a variation on the same theme that uses a for loop, instead of a while loop, to limit the scope of the line variable. Whether it's "better" is a matter of personal taste.

329041 CurrentCulture is the .NET representation of the default user locale of the system. This controls default number and date formatting and the like. CurrentUICulture refers to the default user interface language, a setting introduced in Windows 2000. This is primarily regarding the UI localization/translation part of your app. Whatever regional options the system is configured to have will be the "Current" values in your .NET app. Often times they are both the same. But on my system they would be different: I prefer my numbers and dates in the German format, so the CurrentCulture would be German, but I also prefer all my applications in English, so the CurrentUICulture would be English. There is a nice article on the topic: Sorting it all Out: Why we have both CurrentCulture and CurrentUICulture . (EDIT: The linked blog appears to be dead. The web archive still has a cached copy of that entry.)

At least in the version of OCUnit i'm familiar with SenTestObserver is equal parts useful/equal parts broken. I just skip it altogether and register for the notifications myself in my own class.

You can use the test and run properties of the notification to access the SenTestSuite and SenTestSuiteRun instances, and the run instance contains the info needed on the actual results.
331567 CreateThread() is a raw Win32 API call for creating another thread of control at the kernel level. _beginthread() & _beginthreadex() are C runtime library calls that call CreateThread() behind the scenes. Once CreateThread() has returned, _beginthread/ex() takes care of additional bookkeeping to make the C runtime library usable & consistent in the new thread. In C++ you should almost certainly use _beginthreadex() unless you won't be linking to the C runtime library at all (aka MSVCRT*.dll/.lib).

332367 It drops the students table. The original code in the school's program probably looks something like This is the naive way to add text input into a query, and is very bad, as you will see. After the values for tbFName.Text (which is Robert'); DROP TABLE STUDENTS; --) and tbLName.Text (let's call it Derper) are concatenated with the rest of the query, the result is now actually two queries separated by the statement terminator (semicolon). The second query has been injected into the first. When the code executes this query against the database, it will look like this which, in plain English, roughly translates to the two queries: Add a new record to the Students table with a Name value of 'Robert' and Delete the Students table Everything past the second query is marked as a comment: --', 'Derper') The ' in the student's name is not a comment, it's the closing string delimiter. Since the student's name is a string, it's needed syntactically to complete the hypothetical query. Injection attacks only work when the SQL query they inject results in good SQL (good being very relative in this case). Edited again as per dan04's astute comment
332429 Is there a JavaScript equivalent of Java's class.getName()? No.
333143 I take your question to be about math notation rather than programming. The triple equal sign you refer to can be written &equiv; in html or \equiv in LaTeX. a â‰¡ b most commonly means "a is defined to be b" or "let a be equal to b". So 2+2=4 but Ï† â‰¡ (1+sqrt(5))/2. Here's a handy equivalence table: (The other answers about equivalence relations are correct too but I don't think those are as common. There's also a â‰¡ b (mod m) which is pronounced "a is congruent to b, mod m" and in programmer parlance would be expressed as mod(a,m) == mod(b,m). In other words, a and b are equal after mod'ing by m.) PS: HTML rendering bug! The following table shows up nicely in the preview but doesn't render as a table after I submit it.
333174 Actually, in Java, the references are passed-by-value. In this case, the reference is a byte[] object. Any changes that affect the object itself will be seen from the caller method. However, if you try to replace the reference, for example using new byte[length], you are only replacing the reference that you obtained by pass-by-value, so you are not changing the reference in the caller method. Here's an interesting read about this issue: Java is Pass-by-Value Dammit! Here's an concrete example: This program will create a byte array of length 8 in the main method, which will call the modifyArray method, where the a new byte array of length 16 is created. It may appear that by creating a new byte array in the modifyArray method, that the length of the byte array upon returning to the main method will be 16, however, running this program reveals something different: The length of the byte array upon returning from the modifyArray method reverts to 8 instead of 16. Why is that? That's because the main method called the modifyArray method and sent a copied reference to the new byte[8] by using pass-by-value. Then, the modifyArray method threw away the copied reference by creating a new byte[16]. By the time we leave modifyArray, the reference to the new byte[16] is out of scope (and eventually will be garbage collected.) However, the main method still has reference to the new byte[8] as it only sent the copied reference and not an actual reference to the reference. That should demonstrate that Java will pass reference using pass-by-value.
333217 What are you doing in your method? If you're merely populating an existing array, then you don't need pass-by-reference semantics - either in .NET or in Java. In both cases, the reference will be passed by value - so changes to the object will be visible by the caller. That's like telling someone the address of your house and asking them to deliver something to it - no problem. If you really want pass-by-reference semantics, i.e. the caller will see any changes made to the parameter itself, e.g. setting it to null or a reference to a different byte array, then either method needs to return the new value, or you need to pass a reference to some sort of "holder" which contains a reference to the byte array, and which can have the (possibly changed) reference grabbed from it later. In other words, if your method looks likes this: then you're fine. If your method looks like this: then you need to change it to either: or: For more details, read Parameter passing in C# and Parameter passing in Java. (The former is better written than the latter, I'm afraid. One day I'll get round to doing an update.)
333406 Both JUnit and Maven can run JUnit 4 tests just fine. The only reasons to use JUnit 3 are legacy systems: Either you're force to use a Pre-Java 5 JDK or you have extensive tooling that depends on JUnit 3 and doesn't support JUnit 4.

333704 The Local Hero A test case that is dependent on something specific to the development environment it was written on in order to run. The result is the test passes on development boxes, but fails when someone attempts to run it elsewhere. The Hidden Dependency Closely related to the local hero, a unit test that requires some existing data to have been populated somewhere before the test runs. If that data wasnâ€™t populated, the test will fail and leave little indication to the developer what it wanted, or whyâ€¦ forcing them to dig through acres of code to find out where the data it was using was supposed to come from. Sadly seen this far too many times with ancient .dlls which depend on nebulous and varied .ini files which are constantly out of sync on any given production system, let alone extant on your machine without extensive consultation with the three developers responsible for those dlls.

339077 A finalizer (aka destructor) is part of garbage collection (GC) - it is indeterminate when (or even if) this happens, as GC mainly happens as a result of memory pressure (i.e. need more space). Finalizers are usually only used for cleaning up unmanaged resources, since managed resources will have their own collection/disposal. Hence IDisposable is used to deterministically clean up objects, i.e. now. It doesn't collect the object's memory (that still belongs to GC) - but is used for example to close files, database connections, etc. There are lots of previous topics on this: Finally, note that it is not uncommon for an IDisposable object to also have a finalizer; in this case, Dispose() usually calls GC.SuppressFinalize(this), meaning that GC doesn't run the finalizer - it simply throws the memory away (much cheaper). The finalizer still runs if you forget to Dispose() the object.
339247 The Forty Foot Pole Test Afraid of getting too close to the class they are trying to test, these tests act at a distance, separated by countless layers of abstraction and thousands of lines of code from the logic they are checking. As such they are extremely brittle, and susceptible to all sorts of side-effects that happen on the epic journey to and from the class of interest.

345526 A one-line with 2 tmp files (not what you want) would be: With bash, you might try though: As mentioned in the BenM's detailed answer, < creates anonymous named pipes -- managed by bash -- so they are created and destroyed automatically, unlike temporary files. However, Daniel Cassidy points out the "without using temporary files" part of the question is not respected: the file system is still modified (with a directory entry representing the named pipe created and then removed) Otherwise, like you mention in your question, you have to use - as STDIN , since there seems to be no easy way to pipe multiple inputs to one command. You can only pipe one output to multiple inputs with the tee command: The above command displays the output of ls *.txt to the terminal and outputs it to the text file txtlist.txt.

362133 Hashes in Ruby can't be sorted (at least not before 1.9) This means that looping through a Hash won't necessarily yield the information in the right order for you. However, it's trivial to loop through Hashed data in a particular order by converting it to an Array first, and in fact calling the sort methods on a Hash will convert it into an Array for you: So in your case:
363708 Or take a look to RandomUtils from Apache Commons.
363713 You can edit your second code example to:
363732 Note that this approach is more biased and less efficient than a nextInt approach, https://stackoverflow.com/a/738651/360211 One standard pattern for accomplishing this is: The Java Math library function Math.random() generates a double value in the range [0,1). Notice this range does not include the 1. In order to get a specific range of values first, you need to multiply by the magnitude of the range of values you want covered. This returns a value in the range [0,Max-Min), where 'Max-Min' is not included. For example, if you want [5,10), you need to cover five integer values so you use This would return a value in the range [0,5), where 5 is not included. Now you need to shift this range up to the range that you are targeting. You do this by adding the Min value. You now will get a value in the range [Min,Max). Following our example, that means [5,10): But, this still doesn't include Max and you are getting a double value. In order to get the Max value included, you need to add 1 to your range parameter (Max - Min) and then truncate the decimal part by casting to an int. This is accomplished via: And there you have it. A random integer value in the range [Min,Max], or per the example [5,10]:
364274 isn't the idiomatic python equivalent to C-style ternary operators ie.
364769 Hmmm. There was an answer with a list comprehension here, but it's disappeared. Here: Example: Update: Okay, you want a generator expression, we'll have a generator expression. Here's the list comprehension again, in a for loop: Now we'll construct a generator... and niftily enough, we can assign that to a variable, and use it from there... And to think I used to write FORTRAN.
366026 An enum is only guaranteed to be large enough to hold int values. The compiler is free to choose the actual type used based on the enumeration constants defined so it can choose a smaller type if it can represent the values you define. If you need enumeration constants that don't fit into an int you will need to use compiler-specific extensions to do so.
367344 I'm assuming you mean VB.Net. According to the grammar in the VB Language spec, which you can read here: http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/thankyou.aspx?familyId=39de1dd0-f775-40bf-a191-09f5a95ef500&displayLang=en The result should be "6". This is because the grammar for a "line if statement" is: and "statements" is defined to be Edit: I would like to note that debuging the code is not "cheating". I used to work on the VB compiler team at Microsoft. There were times where the spec was ambiguous, or didn't match what we had actually shipped. In several of those cases the solution (what we did to fix it) was always based on "well... what does the compiler do now". Sometimes we would change the compiler, sometimes we would change the spec. However,we would always run the compiler to see what it actually did before we made a decision. So... debugging the code is a big part of figuring out what it does...

367794 You can check this.constructor: function x(y) { if (this.constructor == x) alert('called with new'); else alert('called as function'); } Yes, the return value is just discarded when used in the new context
369583 Application.AutomationSecurity = msoAutomationSecurity.msoAutomationSecurityForceDisable Try opening the workbook after this statement. I think, this will disable macros at Application Level (not at workbook level) Hope that helps.
370862 This is a feature of UAC to make old applications compatible with Vista. It redirects any request to write to a system folder that the user lacks permission to a local folder. They are stored under "AppData\Local\VirtualStore" folder under the current user's profile. There is a group policy setting to disable this feature: "Virtualize file and registry write failures to per-user locations" Mark Russinovich has a great article on this: Inside Windows Vista User Account Control
370967 Because "abstract" means: "Implements no functionality", and "static" means: "There is functionality even if you don't have an object instance". And that's a logical contradiction.

378675 Why bother using reflector? Just look at the original source code! You should mention the caveats of looking at the source code, though. As Frans Bouma writes: Don't look at the sourcecode of .NET licensed under the 'Reference license'. He cites several risks, all related to the implied acquisition of un-free knowledge which might pose problems when writing own software. The most serious legal risk is probably related to involuntary patent infringements. Also, you're specifically forbidden to contribute to certain other projects, such as ReactOS (and probably Mono), after having looked at similar source code. This might in the future also include the .NET source.
379012 There's also the command line option "+": Will open myfile.txt and do an automatic G for you.
381274 you can do if else statements like this: and then you can also write if - else in an alternate syntax: with the alternate syntax you can also fall out of parsing mode like this: But this gets really messy really fast and I won't recommend it's use (except maybe for template-logic). and to make it complete:
381529 Based on the first sentence of the question: "I'm trying to write out a Byte[] array representing a complete file to a file." The path of least resistance would be: Documented here: System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes - MSDN
382547 I'll add an example of how functional code can be used to safely make code concurrent. Here is some code you might want to do in parallel, so you don't have wait for one file to finish to start downloading the next: If you have a number of files the user might spend a minute or more waiting for them all. We can re-write this code functionally like this, and it basically does the exact same thing: Note that this still runs sequentially. However, not only is it shorter, we've gained an important advantage here. Since each call to the DownloadOneFile function is completely isolated from the others (for our purposes, available bandwidth isn't an issue) you could very easily swap out the ForEach function for another very similar function: one that kicks off each call to DownlaodOneFile on a separate thread from a threadpool. It turns out .Net has just such a function availabe using Parallel Extensions. So, by using functional programming you can change one line of code and suddenly have something run in parallel that used to run sequentially. That's pretty powerful.
383245 I googled for code to merge object properties and ended up here. However since there wasn't any code for recursive merge I wrote it myself. (Maybe jQuery extend is recursive b.t.w.?) Anyhow, Hopefully someone else will find it useful as well. (Now the code does not use Object.prototype :)
383712 I found an article at "Pete W.'s Idea Book" blog that was invaluable to setting up TeamCity and Visual SVN for me. VisualSVN + TeamCity + NAnt + SQL Server Even talks about getting SQL Server 2005 working with TeamCity (although, I believe it works out of the box with TeamCity 4.x). Integration with NAnt helped, too. This is a good introduction and tutorial article.

386996 Everyone is suggesting MySQL fulltext search, however you should be aware of a HUGE caveat. The Fulltext search engine is only available for the MyISAM engine (not InnoDB, which is the most commonly used engine due to its referential integrity and ACID compliance). So you have a few options: 1. The simplest approach is outlined by Particle Tree. You can actaully get ranked searches off of pure SQL (no fulltext, no nothing). The SQL query below will search a table and rank results based off the number of occurrences of a string in the search fields: edited their example to provide a bit more clarity Variations on the above SQL query, adding WHERE statements (WHERE p.body LIKE '%whatever%you%want'), etc. will probably get you exactly what you need. 2. You can alter your database schema to support full text. Often what is done to keep the InnoDB referential integrity, ACID compliance, and speed without having to install plugins like Sphinx Fulltext Search Engine for MySQL is to split the quote data into it's own table. Basically you would have a table Quotes that is an InnoDB table that, rather than having your TEXT field "data" you have a reference "quote_data_id" which points to the ID on a Quote_Data table which is a MyISAM table. You can do your fulltext on the MyISAM table, join the IDs returned with your InnoDB tables and voila you have your results. 3. Install Sphinx. Good luck with this one. Given what you described, I would HIGHLY recommend you take the 1st approach I presented since you have a simple database driven site. The 1st solution is simple, gets the job done quickly. Lucene will be a bitch to setup especially if you want to integrate it with the database as Lucene is designed mainly to index files not databases. Google custom site search just makes your site lose tons of reputation (makes you look amateurish and hacked), and MySQL fulltext will most likely cause you to alter your database schema.
387289 Here's a jQuery way to implement Joel's suggestion:
387711 if you don't need to bind it, try: Text='<%# string.Format("{0:HH:mm}", Eval("Appointment"))%>' otherwise i suppose you can update the field value in the OnDataBound event.
387733 Here's the way to do it without using any external libraries: Now the real answer is a whole lot more complex than that. For instance, there is no such thing as classes in JavaScript. JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance scheme. In addition, there are numerous popular JavaScript libraries that have their own style of approximating class-like functionality in JavaScript. You'll want to check out at least Prototype and jQuery. Deciding which of these is the "best" is a great way to start a holy war on StackÂ Overflow. If you're embarking on a larger JavaScript-heavy project, it's definitely worth learning a popular library and doing it their way. I'm a Prototype guy, but StackÂ Overflow seems to lean towards jQuery. As far as there being only "one way to do it", without any dependencies on external libraries, the way I wrote is pretty much it.

388054 In my app, I have a sql lite DB which I just dropped in the root of my project folder and added to the resources folder of my project, and it winds up in the bundle, accessible by the app. I assume this will work for any file. I didn't have to write any special targets or operations.
