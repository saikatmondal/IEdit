                <p> How do you express an integer as a binary number with python literals?</p>

<p> I was easily able to find the answer for hex:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 0x12AF
4783
&gt;&gt;&gt; 0x100
256
</code></pre>

<p> and, octal:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 01267
695
&gt;&gt;&gt; 0100
64

<p><strong><em>Summary of Answers</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li> Python 2.5 and earlier: can express binary using <code>int('01010101111',2)</code> but not with a literal.</li>
<li> Python 2.5 and earlier: there is <em>no way</em> to express binary literals.</li>
<li> Python 2.6 beta: You can do like so: <code>0b1100111</code> or <code>0B1100111</code>  .</li>
<li> Python 2.6 beta: will also allow <code>0o27</code> or <code>0O27</code> (second character is the letter O) to represent an octal.  </li>
<li> Python 3.0 beta: Same as 2.6, but will no longer allow the older <code>027</code> syntax for octals.</li>

                <p> Once I've called <code>DragManager.acceptDrag</code> is there any way to ""unaccept"" the drag? Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(this)</code> (from a <code>DragEvent.DRAG_OVER</code> handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the <code>DragManager.NONE</code> feedback. However, neither calling <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(null)</code> nor <code>DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE)</code> seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it.</p>

<p> Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary.</p><span class=""diff-delete"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-delete""> I've managed to get it working in both AIR and the browser now, but only by putting proxy components on top of the ranges of text where you should be able to drop things. That way I get the right feedback and drops are automatically unaccepted on drag exit.</span></p><span class=""diff-delete"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-delete""> This is the oddest thing about D&amp;D in AIR:</span></p><span class=""diff-delete"">

</span><pre><code><span class=""diff-delete"">DragManager.doDrag(initiator, source, event, dragImage, offsetX, offsetY);
</span></code></pre><span class=""diff-delete"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-delete""> In browser-based Flex, </span><code><span class=""diff-delete"">offsetX</span></code><span class=""diff-delete""> and </span><code><span class=""diff-delete"">offsetY</span></code><span class=""diff-delete""> should be negative (so says the documentation, and it works fine). However, when running </span><em><span class=""diff-delete"">exactly the same code</span></em><span class=""diff-delete""> in AIR you have to make the offsets positive. The same numbers, but positive. That is very, very weird.</span></p>

                <p> Once I've called <code>DragManager.acceptDrag</code> is there any way to ""unaccept"" the drag? Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(this)</code> (from a <code>DragEvent.DRAG_OVER</code> handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the <code>DragManager.NONE</code> feedback. However, neither calling <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(null)</code> nor <code>DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE)</code> seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it.</p>

<p> Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary.</p>

                <p> I'm looking for a Java library for SWIFT messages. I want to</p>

<ul>
<li> parse SWIFT messages into an object model</li>
<li> validate SWIFT messages (including SWIFT network validation rules)</li>
<li> build / change SWIFT messages by using an object model</li>
</ul>

<p> Theoretically, I need to support all SWIFT message types. But at the moment I need MT103+, MT199, MT502, MT509, MT515 and MT535.</p>

<p> So far I've looked at two libraries</p>

<ul>
<li> AnaSys Message Objects (<a href=""http://www.anasys.com/products/messageobjects/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link text</a>)</li>
<li> Datamation SWIFT Message Suite (<a href=""http://www.paymentcomponents.com/swift/message_suite/components_suite.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link text</a>)</li>

<p> AnaSys uses a internal XML representation for all SWIFT messages which you need to know in order to access the fields of a message. And you need to operate on the DOM of the XML representation, there is no way to say ""get the contents of field '50K' of the SWIFT message"".</p>

<p> this is great, of course, but the list of links I want to use needs to be generated dynamically from the database. This means that I need to create this JS file from the server on page load.

<p> A quick Google search brings up the last 2 lines, but nobody in cyberspace has ever reported the first message before.  (Hooray!  I'm first at SOMETHING on the 'net!)</p>

My machine has been able to do the build before.  I have no idea what changed that upset the delicate balance of things on my box.
I have also tried all the traditional rituals i.e. closing Visual Studio, blowing away all the bin and obj folders, rebooting, etc. to no avail.</p>

<p> For simplicity's sake, I created a little ""Hello World"" app with a deployment file.
Herewith the build output:</p>

                <p> I'm building a function to extend the Enum.Parse concept that</p>

<ul>
<li> allows a default value to be parsed in case that an Enum value is not found</li>
<li> Is case insensitive</li>

<p> So I wrote the following </p>

<pre><code>        public static T GetEnumFromString&lt;T&gt;(string value, T defaultValue) where T : Enum<span class=""diff-delete"">, IConvertible</span>

        }

<p> I am getting a Error Constraint cannot be special class 'System.Enum'</p>

<p> Fair enough, but is there a workaround to allow a Generic Enum, or am I going to have to mimic the Parse function and pass a type as an attribute, which forces the ugly boxing requirement to your code.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> All suggestions below have been greatly appreciated, thanks</p>

                    <h1><span class=""title-diff""><span class=""diff-add""> Is it possible, by any stable method, to enable ReadyBoost on Windows Server 2008</span>?</span></h1>
                <p> I <span class=""diff-add"">know the standard answer is No. However hear out the reasons for wanting it, and then we'll go for whether it is possible to achieve the same effect as ReadyBoost via either enabling (and installing) ReadyBoost or using third party software.</span></p><span class=""diff-add"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> Reasons for using Widows Server 2008 as a development environment on a laptop:</span></p><span class=""diff-add"">

</span><ol><span class=""diff-add"">
</span><li><span class=""diff-add""> 64-Bit, so you get the full use of 4GB RAM.</span></li><span class=""diff-add"">
</span><li><span class=""diff-add""> SharePoint developer, so you can run SharePoint locally and debug successfully.</span></li><span class=""diff-add"">
</span><li><span class=""diff-add""> Hyper-V, so you get hardware virtualisation of test environments and the ability to demo full solutions stored in Hyper-V on the road</span></li><span class=""diff-add"">
</span></ol><span class=""diff-add"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> So all of that equals: Windows Server 2008 (64) on a laptop.</span></p><span class=""diff-add"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> Now because we are running Hyper-V, we require a large volume of disk space. This means we are using 5,000 rpm 250GB HDD.</span></p><span class=""diff-add"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> So we are on a laptop, we are not able to use solid state HDD, and we only have 4GB of RAM and the throughput of a laptop motherboard rather than a server one... all of which means we are not flying... this thing isn't a sluggard but it's not zippy either.</span></p><span class=""diff-add"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> Windows Server 2008 is based on the same code base as Vista. Vista features ReadyBoost, which enables USB 2 flash devices to be used as a weak cache for system files, which visibly increases the performance of Vista. As the codebases are similar, it should be possible for ReadyBoost to work on WS2008, however Microsoft have not shipped or enabled ReadyBoost in WS2008.</span></p><span class=""diff-add"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> Given that we are running WS2008 on a laptop as a development environment, how can we achieve the performance gains of ReadyBoost through the use of flash devices in Windows Server 2008</span>?</p><span class=""diff-add"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> For the answer to be accepted it must outline an end to end process for achieving the performance gain.</span></p><span class=""diff-add"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> Answers of 'No' will not be accepted as I understand some third party tools achieve some of the functionality, but I haven't seen a full end-to-end description of how to get going with them.</span></p>

                <p> There are pages scattered around the web that describe POSIX AIO facilities in varying amounts of detail.  None of them are terribly recent.  It's not clear what, exactly, they're describing.  For example, the ""official"" (?) <a href=""http://lse.sourceforge.net/io/aio.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">web site for Linux kernel asynchronous I/O support here</a> says that sockets don't work, but the ""aio.h"" manual pages on my Ubuntu 8.04.1 workstation all seem to imply that it works for arbitrary file descriptors.  Then there's <a href=""http://www.bullopensource.org/posix/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">another project that seems to work at the library layer</a> with even less documentation.</p>

<p> I'd like to know:</p>

<ul>
<li> What is the purpose of POSIX AIO?  Given that the most obvious example of an implementation I can find says it doesn't support sockets, the whole thing seems weird to me.  Is it just for async disk I/O?  If so, why the hyper-general API?  If not, why is disk I/O the first thing that got attacked?</li>
<li> Where are there <span class=""diff-delete"">examples of</span> <em>complete</em> POSIX AIO programs that I can look at?</li>
<li> Does anyone actually use it, for real?</li>
<li> What platforms support POSIX AIO?  What parts of it do they support?  Does anyone really support the implied ""Any I/O to any FD"" that <code>&lt;aio.h&gt;</code> seems to promise?</li>

<p> The other multiplexing mechanisms available to me are perfectly <span class=""diff-delete"">fine</span>, but the random fragments of information floating around <span class=""diff-delete"">on the internet</span> have made me curious.</p>

                <p> Here's a simplified version of what I'm trying to do :</p>

<ol>
<li> Before any other actions are performed, present the user with a form to retrieve a string.</li>
<li> Input the string, and then redirect to the default controller action (e.g. index).  The string only needs to exist, no other validations are necessary.</li>
<li> The string must be available (as an instance variable?) to all the actions in this controller.</li>
</ol>

<p> I'm very new with Rails, but this doesn't seem like it ought to be exceedingly hard, so I'm feeling kind of dumb.</p>

<p> What I've tried :
I have a <code>before_filter</code> redirecting to a private method that looks like</p>

<pre class=""default prettyprint prettyprinted"" style=""""><code><span class=""kwd"">def</span><span class=""pln""> check_string

    get_string

<p> This fails because i have two render or redirect calls in the same action.  I can take out that first <code>respond_to</code>, of course, but what happens is that the controller gets trapped in the <code>get_string</code> method.  I can more or less see why that's happening, but I don't know how to fix it and break out.  I need to be able to show one form (View), get and then do something with the input string, and then proceed as normal.</p>

<p> The <code>get_string.html.erb</code> file looks like </p>

<pre class=""default prettyprint prettyprinted"" style=""""><code><span class=""tag"">&lt;h1&gt;</span><span class=""pln"">Enter a string</span><span class=""tag"">&lt;/h1&gt;</span><span class=""pln"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> Thanks for the replies...</span><br><span class=""diff-add"">
@Laurie Young : You are right, I was misunderstanding.  For some reason I had it in my head that the instance of any given controller invoked by a user would persist throughout their session, and that some of the  Rails magic was in tracking objects associated with each user session.  I can see why that doesn't make a whole lot of sense in retrospect, and why my attempt to use an instance variable (which I'd thought would persist) won't work.  Thanks to you as well :)</span></p>

I know ActionScript pretty decently, and don't feel like messing around with some new XML language just to get some simple UI in there. Can anyone provide an example consisting of an .as file which can be compiled (ideally via FlashDevelop, though just telling how to do it with the Flex SDK is ok too) and uses the Flex Framework? For example, just showing a Flex button that pops open an Alert would be perfect.</p>

                <p> I need to generate an XML file in C#.</p>

<p> I want to write the code that generates this in a file that is mostly <span class=""diff-delete"">XML</span> with code inside of it <span class=""diff-delete"">similar to how templating works</span> in ASP.NET. </p>

<p> So I want a code file that looks like:</p>

                <p> I've developed a windows application that uses shared memory---that is---memory mapped files for interprocess communication.  I have a windows service that does some processing and periodically writes data to the memory mapped file.  I have a separate windows application that reads from the memory mapped file and displays the information.  The application works as expected on Windows XP, XP Pro and Server 2003, but NOT on Vista.</p>

<p> I can see that the data being written to the memory mapped file is happening correctly by the windows service because I can open the file with a text editor and see the stored messages, but the ""consumer"" application can't read from the file.  One interesting thing to note here, is that if I close the consumer application and restart it, it consumes the messages that were previously written to the memory mapped file.  </p>

<p> Also, another strange thing is that I get the same behavior when I connect to the windows host using Remote Desktop and invoke/use the consumer application through remote desktop.  However, if I invoke the Remote Desktop and connect to the target host's console session with the following command: <code>mstsc -v:servername /F -console</code>, everything works perfectly.  </p>

<p> So that's why I think the problem is related to permissions.  Can anyone comment on this?</p>

<p> EDIT:</p>

<p> The ACL that I'm using to create the memory mapped file and the Mutex objects that sychronize access is as follows:</p>

                <p> <span class=""diff-add"">I'm a long-time C#/.NET programmer but totally new to WPF and the System.Windows.Controls namespace and XAML.

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> My question is to those who have been working on WPF for longer and ideally those who have shipped apps with it -- where did you find was the best place to 'draw the line' between XAML and code?  Did you use XAML wherever you could?  Only where interfacing with non-coding UI designers? </span></p><span class=""diff-add"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> Any tips in this area would be extremely helpful to myself and other coders who are just getting into WPF programming and are kind of paralyzed by all the choices we can make!</span></p>

                <p> My printer ran out of black toner and I didnt have a spare, so I thought itd be a good idea to print documents to .XPS files for now, then print them when the new toner arrives.</p>

<p> So, now I have my toner but I cant work out how to print the files.

<p> I can open them and view them in IE, but if I try to print them it either ignores the command altogether or crashes.</p>

<p> I downloaded the XPS Essentials Pack from the Microsoft website and tried to install it, but it refuses to install and keeps crashing with a ten-page error message. Ironically, I would normally print this message out to deal with it.</p>

<p> My solution is to open the .XPS files in IE, then screenshot them and paste them into Paint Shop Pro so I can print them as graphics.</p>

                <p> It's common in C++ to name member variables with some kind of prefix to denote the fact that they're member variables, rather than local variables or parameters. If you've come from an MFC background, you'll probably use <code>m_foo</code>. I've also seen <code>myFoo</code> occasionally.</p>

<p> C# (or possibly just .NET) seems to recommend using just an underscore, as in <code>_foo</code>. Is this allowed by the C++ standard?</p>

                <p> Alright, after doing a ton of research and trying almost every managed CPP Redist I can find as well as trying to copy my DLLs locally to the executing directory of the app I cannot figure out what dependencies i'm missing for this mixed mode library.</p>

<p> Basically I have a large C# <span class=""diff-delete""> and</span> I'm trying to use a mixed mode library I made.

<p> I have used dependency walker to check all the DLLs referenced and ensured they exist on the deployment machine with <span class=""diff-delete"">excellent</span> luck, I'm wondering if maybe it's some dependencies that need to be registered that I am missing, but i can't figure out what.</p>

<p> I get the following exception when code class from the mixed mode library.</p>

<p> Surely there's a way to call this bit of timing code as a fancy-schmancy .NET 3.0 lambda rather than (God forbid) cutting and pasting it a few times and replacing the <strong><code>DoStuff(s)</code></strong> with <strong><code>DoSomethingElse(s)</code></strong>?</p>

<p> I know it can be done as a <code>Delegate</code> but I'm wondering <span class=""diff-add"">about</span> the <span class=""diff-add"">lambda way</span>.</p>

                <p> I am building a PHP app in CodeIgniter.  CI sends all requests to the main controller, /index.php.  </p>

<p> However, I don't like to see the index.php in the URL, so I've used mod_rewrite, as per the CI documentation.</p>

<p> The rule is as follows:</p>

<p> I need a reliable way for a script to know what <span class=""diff-delete"">its</span> address is, so it will know what to do with the navigation.  </p>

                <p> I am thinking about adding a third monitor to my coding station.</p>

<p> I currently run 1600x1200 on a dell 20.1"", which is ok, but I am thinking to move to something that will do 1920x1200.</p>

<p> I'm doing the purchase on eBay, so can't really see the monitor beforehand.</p>

<p> Last time I bought a ""Widescreen"" (I read ""ShortScreen"") monitor, I hated it.  In real space, I gained a couple inches width, but I lost a lot off the height.  It was like getting my monitor cut in half.</p>

<p> I'm looking at the Dell 24"" or a SOYO 26"".  I want to make sure that the height of the screen isn't less than what I have now, in actual inches, so that the 1200 I get will be the same as the 1200 I have now, and it will just be like adding an extra 320px to the side of my existing monitor.</p>

<p> Most of the monitors I have looked at include the HxWxD, but it's for the whole thing, including sides, stand, etc.  For the life of me, I can't seem to find an actual measure of screen height and width, other than diagonal, which could be anything, depending on the diagonal angle.</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone have experience with the Dell 24"" 248WFP or the Soyo Pearl 26"", or have any idea on a resource that would show how TALL the screen is or square inches?</strong></p>

<p> At this point, I'd be happy if someone could just measure their screen height with a ruler for me =o)</p>

                <p> I have a .NET application distributed through clickonce. Security within the application is implemented through the WindowsPrincipal.IsInRole(GroupName) method using a set of groups as resources. This structure works well for us for users within the same domain as the groups. Unfortunately we now have users that need to use the application working on machines and using user accounts in a different domain that is trusted by our domain but is not in the same forest. </p>

<p> It seems that IsInRole() queries the AD ticket on the local machine for group membership. Unfortunately this ticket only contains domain-local groups for the domain of the machine and global and universal groups of other trusted domains, our groups are domain-local groups in the first domain. The catch-22 situation comes from the fact that AD does not allow foreign security principals in either global or universal groups and therefore while it can be queried by the users in the second domain they cannot be members of it (making it a little pointless!)</p>

<p> To explain:
There are two domains: DOM1 and DOM2 with a trust setup between them, but they are not in the same forest.</p>

<p> DOM1\User1<br>
DOM2\User2<br>
are two users.</p>

<p> I would like to put both User1 and User2 in one group that is visible to both users and can contain them both.</p>

<p> The only way I can currently see around it is the following (where {} denotes the members of the groups, DL=Domain Local and GLO=GlobalGroup.)</p>

<p> Make two global groups one in each domain:<br>
DOM1\GLOGroup1 : {DOM1\User1}<br>
DOM2\GLOGroup1 : {DOM2\User2}</p>

<p> and two domain-local groups containing the two global groups:<br>
DOM1\DLGroup1 : {DOM1\GLOGroup1, DOM2\GLOGroup1}<br>
DOM2\DLGroup1 : {DOM1\GLOGroup1, DOM2\GLOGroup1}</p>

<p> But this isn't really acceptable as we actually have more than two domains and about 70 groups to administer including a hierarchy of groups and we don't have much direct control over the administration of groups in the other domains.</p>

<p> We haven't yet worked through any thinking on an approach using LDAP but from the little that I've read I believe it's not generally recommended for this purpose?</p>

                <p> I have a .NET application distributed through clickonce. Security within the application is implemented through the WindowsPrincipal.IsInRole(GroupName) method using a set of groups as resources. This structure works well for us for users within the same domain as the groups. Unfortunately we now have users that need to use the application working on machines and using user accounts in a different domain that is trusted by our domain but is not in the same forest. </p>

<p> It seems that IsInRole() queries the AD ticket on the local machine for group membership. Unfortunately this ticket only contains domain-local groups for the domain of the machine and global and universal groups of other trusted domains, our groups are domain-local groups in the first domain. The catch-22 situation comes from the fact that AD does not allow foreign security principals in either global or universal groups and therefore while it can be queried by the users in the second domain they cannot be members of it (making it a little pointless!)</p>

<p> To explain:
There are two domains: DOM1 and DOM2 with a trust setup between them, but they are not in the same forest.</p>

<p> DOM1\User1<br>
DOM2\User2<br>
are two users.</p>

<p> I would like to put both User1 and User2 in one group that is visible to both users and can contain them both.</p>

<p> The only way I can currently see around it is the following (where {} denotes the members of the groups, DL=Domain Local and GLO=GlobalGroup.)</p>

<p> Make two global groups one in each domain:<br>
DOM1\GLOGroup1 : {DOM1\User1}<br>
DOM2\GLOGroup1 : {DOM2\User2}</p>

<p> and two domain-local groups containing the two global groups:<br>
DOM1\DLGroup1 : {DOM1\GLOGroup1, DOM2\GLOGroup1}<br>
DOM2\DLGroup1 : {DOM1\GLOGroup1, DOM2\GLOGroup1}</p>

<p> But this isn't really acceptable as we actually have more than two domains and about 70 groups to administer including a hierarchy of groups and we don't have much direct control over the administration of groups in the other domains.</p>

<p> However it is not being called. get_employee.php works fine when I call it by itself, so that is not the problem. Is there anything wrong in my code that would prevent it from being called? I cannot test with any firefox extensions, I do not have access, so please don't give that as an answer<span class=""diff-add"">.</span></p><span class=""diff-add"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-add""> edit: the problem is the javascript is not being called at all. I fixed the question mark problem, but even just a simple javascript with an alert is not being called</span>.</p>

<p> Against my will, Subversion has now included ""unwanted change"" into the trunk code, and I need to weed them out manually. Is there a way to merge only specified revisions when multiple consecutive changes are made in the branch?</p>

<p> The part of the problem is that B (unwated change) is included in .merge-right and I can't tell the difference between which revision it came from.</p>

<p> Against my will, Subversion has now included ""unwanted change"" into the trunk code, and I need to weed them out manually. Is there a way to merge only specified revisions when multiple consecutive changes are made in the branch?</p>

<p> The part of the problem is that B (unwated change) is included in .merge-right and I can't tell the difference between which revision it came from.<span class=""diff-add""> I usually use TortoiseMerge and here's how it looks.</span></p><span class=""diff-add"">

                <p> We have a .NET object that does a lot of reading/writing with the database. Throughout the life cycle of this object (or the asp page that uses it), it may hit the database with a query/update anywhere from 1 to 10 times. </p>

<p> Instead of opening and closing a database connection every time the object needs to hit the database, it simply opens a connection to the database during instantiation and then closes the connection during the object's termination event. Is that a bad practice?</p>

<p> The assumption was that since the object hits the database every time it's instantiated (and usually multiple times), it would be better to just open a connection at the beginning of the object's life and then close it at the end. </p>

<p> The other alternative is to open and close the database connection before and after each query/operation. </p>

<p> What's the best practice here in order to maximize performance? </p><span class=""diff-add"">

Thanks for the tips guys. Can anyone speak more to the method of opening/closing a connection inside an object's instantiation/termination events and the repercussions of doing so? </span></p>

                <p> I am looking to refactor a c# method into a c function in an attempt to gain some speed, and then call the c dll in c# to allow my program to use the functionality.</p>

<p> Currently the c# method takes a list of integers and returns a list of lists of integers.  The method calculated the power set of the integers so an input of 3 ints would produce the following output (at this stage the values of the ints is not important as it is used as an internal weighting value)</p>

<pre><code>1
2
3
1,2
1,3
2,3
1,2,3
</code></pre>

<p> Where each line represents a list of integers.  The output indicates the index (with an offset of 1) of the first list, not the value.  So 1,2 indicates that the element at index 0 and 1 are an element of the power set.</p>

<p> I am unfamiliar with c, so what are my best options for data structures that will allow the c# to access the returned data?</p>

<p> Thanks in advance</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p> Thank you all for your comments so far. Here is a bit of a background to the nature of the problem.</p>

<p> The iterative method for calculating the power set of a set is fairly straight forward.  Two loops and a bit of bit manipulation is all there is to it really.  It just get called..a lot (in fact billions of times if the size of the set is big enough).</p>

<p> My thoughs around using c (c++ as people have pointed out) are that it gives more scope for performance tuning.  A direct port may not offer any increase, but it opens the way for more involved methods to get a bit more speed out of it.  Even a small increase per iteration would equate to a measurable increase.</p>

<p> My idea was to port a direct version and then work to increase it.  And then refactor it over time (with help from everyone here at SO).</p>

keybd_event(key, 0, KEYEVENTF_KEYUP, 0); // key goes up

<p> Now this code does send the character ""a"" to any local window, but it will not send to the remote desktop window. </p>

<p> What that means is i use Remote Desktop to connect to a server, and i then open Notepad on that server. If i manually punch keys on the keyboard: they appear in Notepad's editor window. But keybd_event's fake keyboard input not causing ""a""'s to appear in Notepad.</p>

                <p> I'm writing an application that allows users to upload images onto the server. I expect about 20 images per day all jpeg and probably not edited/resized. (This is another question, how to resize the images on the server side before storing. Maybe someone can please drop a .NET resource for that in the comment or so). 
I wonder now what the best practice for storing uploaded images is.</p>

<p> Is it 
<strong>a) I store the images as a file in the file system and create a record in a table with the exact path to that image.</strong></p>

<p> or 
<strong>b) I store the image itself in a table using an ""image"" or ""binary data"" data type of the database server.</strong></p>

<p> I see advantages and disadvantages in both. 
I like a) because I can easily relocate the files and just have to change the table entry. On the other hand I don't like storing business data on the web server and I don't really want to connect the web server to any other datasource that holds business data (for security reasons) 
I like b) because all the information is in one place and easily accessible by a query. On the other hand the database will get very big very soon. Outsourcing that data could be more difficult.</p>

For a framework, I feel it should at least make db access easy, manage sessions, basic security that a webapp would need, templating and code reuse (or libraries that make basic tasks easy).</span></p>

Shouldn't they be more concerned with handling the logic between data-fetch and data-show (e.g. turning a contact's group ID into a displayable name)? And data-save and data-write (e.g. figuring out how to turn $_POST values into savable data)?</p>

                <p> So like many people, I'm excited about Ruby on Rails. Being a Windows user, I downloaded InstantRails, got it going, and followed along with the screencast on how to make a blog with RoR 2.0 in fifteen minutes. I used Notepad++ as my text editor, because that's what I've traditionally used for writing the PHP-based websites I've done in the past. I was a little envious of Mac users and how they get the really attractive-looking TextMate, but I managed to follow through the entire screencast and get everything working smoothly.</p>

<p> However, I was lost most of the time.</p>

<p> I know plenty of programming and scripting languages over the years - C++, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, and Lua just to name a few. I don't know Ruby, but I understand a lot of how it works, as far as the syntax is concerned, but I don't understand a lot of the logic behind why certain files do certain things, and that sort of thing.</p>

<p> Also, I tried Aptana with RadRails, but found it difficult to set up. Is there any concrete tutorial for getting it set up and working fully with Ruby on Rails 2.0?</p>

<p> Should I maybe just wait for more RoR 2.0 tutorials to come out before attempting to learn RoR? Or should I just plow on through and experiment until I figure it out?</p>

                    <h1><span class=""title-diff""> Is there a way to split a widescreen monitor in to two virtual monitors?</span></h1>
                <p> Like most developers I have grown to love dual monitors. I won't go into all the reasons for their goodness; just take it as a given.</p>

<p> However, they are not perfect. You can never seem to line them up ""just right"". You always end up with the monitors at slight funny angles. And of course the bezel always gets in the way. And this is with identical monitors. The problem is much worse with different monitors -- VMWare's multi monitor feature won't even work with monitors of differnt resolutions.</p>

<p> When you use multiple monnitors, one of them becomes your primary monitor of focus. Your focus may flip from one monitor to the other, but at any point in time you are usually focusing on only one monitor. There are exceptions to this (WinDiff, Excel), but this is generally the case. I suggest that having a single large monitor with all the benefits of multiple smaller monitors would be a better solution.</p>

<p> Wide screen monitors are fantastic, but it is hard to use all the space efficiently. If you are writing code you are generally working on the left-hand side of the window. If you maximize an editor on a wide-screen monitor the right-hand side of the window will be a sea of white. Programs like WinSplit Revolution will help to organise your windows, but this is really just addressing the symptom, not the problem. Even with WinSplit Revolution, when you maximise a window it will take up the whole screen. You can't lock a window into a specific section of the screen.</p>

<p> This is where virtual monitors comes in. </p>

<p> What would be really nice is a video driver that sits on top of the existing driver, but allows a single monitor to be virtualised into multiple monitors. Control Panel would see your single physical monitor as two or more virtual monitors. The software could even support a virtual bezel to emphasise what is happening, or you could opt for seamless mode. Programs like WinSplit Revolution and UltraMon would still work. This virtual video driver would allow you to slice &amp; dice your physical monitor into as many virtual monitors as you want. </p>

<p> Does anybody know if such software exists? If not, are there any budding Windows display driver guru's out there willing to take up the challenge?</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint prettyprinted"" style=""""><code><span class=""pln"">litWeight</span><span class=""pun"">.</span><span class=""typ"">Text</span><span class=""pln""> </span><span class=""pun"">=</span><span class=""pln""> person</span><span class=""pun"">.</span><span class=""typ"">Weight</span><span class=""pun"">.</span><span class=""typ"">ToString</span><span class=""pun"">(</span><span class=""str"">""0.00""</span><span class=""pun"">);</span></code></pre>

<p> <span class=""diff-add"">all over the place.
Now</span> I know for a fact that in several instances, and am suspicious of many others that the client is likely to want the values to 3d.p. in the future.</p>

<p> Is there some pattern I can employ to handle the formatting of this Weight property (and other properties; not just decimals, perhaps dates etc.) so that I can have this formatting in a single place?</p>

<p> I know could use a formatstring in the webconfig, or write some extension methods in the UI but these don't seem very elegant solutions.</p>

<p> It would be nice to have some formatting objects which are tied to my entities, so its inherently obvious which formatter to use.</p>

<p> Thanks,</p>

<p> Andrew</p>

                <p> I was wondering what I could do to improve the performance of Excel automation, as it can be quite slow if you have a lot going on in the worksheet...</p>

<p> Here's a few I found myself:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>ExcelApp.ScreenUpdating = false</code> -- turn of the redrawing of the screen</p></li>
<li><p><code>ExcelApp.Calculation = Excel.XlCalculation.xlCalculationManual</code> -- turning of the calculation engine so Excel doesn't autotomatically recalculates when a cell value changes (turn it back on after you're done)</p></li>
<li><p> Reduce calls to <code>Worksheet.Cells.Item(row, col)</code> and <code>Worksheet.Range</code> -- I had to poll hundreds of cells to find the cell I needed. Implementing some caching of cell locations, reduced the execution time from ~40 to ~5 seconds.</p></li>
</ul>

<p> What kind of interop calls take a heavy toll on performance and should be avoided? What else <span class=""diff-delete"">casn</span> you do to avoid unnecessary processing being done?</p>

<p> Is it just so if you were to do:</p>

<pre><code>IInterface classRef = new ObjectWhatever()

<p> You could use any class that implements <code>IInterface</code>? When would you need to do that? The only thing I can think of is if you have a method and you are unsure of what object will be passed expect for it implementing <code>IInterface</code>. I cannot think how often you would need to do that... (Also, how could you write a method that takes in a object that implements an interface? Is that possible?)</p>

I'm kinda impressed by Hudson</span>, <span class=""diff-add"">because it is so</span> easy to set up<span class=""diff-add"">.

I for example had no problems setting up Hudson. Cruise Control seemd</span> kinda messy but still <span class=""diff-add"">i</span> got it working<span class=""diff-add""> too.

<p> Calling Device.Reset recovered the Device. No problem. But when I lost the device a second time (for example, when the computer was locked, went to sleep, or activated a screen-saver), an exception was thrown by Device.Reset. </p>

<p> The exception was InvalidCallException, which (according to the documentation) means something went wrong with the call. So I assumed it was a problem with the arguments to the function. So instead of passing the same copy of <code><span class=""diff-delete"">PresentParams</span></code> that I used to create the Device, I created a new instance of PresentParams (at first using the copy constructor, and later by re-creating without it) and passed that to Device.Reset.</p>

<p> Doesn't work. Device.Reset still dies with the InvalidCallException. Oh, and the message of the exception? ""Error in application."" Not helpful.</p>

<p> Can you point me in the direction of either a solution, or some documentation about how to get more debug information out of DirectX?</p>
