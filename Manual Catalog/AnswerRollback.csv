 <p> The page also recommends using lambda unless you specifically want the error tolerant behavior. I agree with this sentiment. Using a lambda seems a tad more concise, and with such an insignificant difference, it seems the better choice in the average situation.</p>

 <p> My opinions on these are:</p> 
 <p> 1) No, table names should be singular.</p> 
 <p> While it appears to make sense for the simple selection (<code>select * from Orders</code>) it makes less sense for the OO equivalent (<code>Orders x = new Orders</code>).</p> 
 <p> A table in a DB is really the set of that entity, it makes more sense once you're using set-logic:</p> 
 <pre><code>select Orders.*
from Orders inner join Products
    on Orders.Key = Products.Key
</code></pre> 
 <p> That last line, the actual logic of the join, looks confusing with plural table names.</p> 
 <p> I'm not sure about always using an alias (as Matt suggests) clears that up.</p> 
 <p> 2) They should be singular as they only hold 1 property</p> 
 <p> 3) Never, if the column name is ambiguous (as above where they both have a column called [Key]) the name of the table (or its alias) can distinguish them well enough. You want queries to be quick to type and simple - prefixes add unnecessary complexity.</p> 
 <p> 4) Whatever you want, I'd suggest <span class=""diff-delete"">PascalCase</span></p> 
 <p> I don't think there's one set of absolute guidelines on any of these. </p>

 <p> RECOVERY WITH STANDBY is the ability to restore the database up to a parital date (like NORECOVERY above) but to allow the database still to be used READONLY. New transaction logs can still be applied to the database to keep it up to date (a standby server). Use this when it would take too long to restore a full database in order to Return To Operations the system. (ie. if you have a multi TB database that would take 16 hours to restore, but could receive transaction log updates every 15 minutes).</p>

                <p> [Executive Summary:  Use ++i if you don't have a specific reason to use i++.]</p>

<p> For C++, the answer is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p> If i is a simple type (not an instance of a C++ class) then the answer given for C holds, since the compiler is generating the code.</p>

<p> However, if i is an instance of a C++ class, then i++ and ++i are making calls to the operator++() function.  Here's a standard pair of these functions:</p>

<pre><code>const Foo&amp; Foo::operator++() // called for ++i

{

    this-&gt;data += 1;

}
</code></pre>

<p> Since the compiler isn't generating code, but just calling the operator++ function, there is no way to optimize away the tmp variable and its associated copy constructor.  If the copy constructor is expensive then this can have a significant performance impact.</p>

                <p> Read all the answers but I think <strong>lambdas and type inferrence</strong> is underrated.</p>

<p> Havn't seen anyone mentioned that <strong>Lambdas can have multiple statement</strong> and they <strong>double as a compatible delegate object</strong> automatically (just make sure the signature match) as in:</p>

<pre><code>Console.CancelKeyPress +=
    (sender, e) =&gt; {
        Console.WriteLine(""CTRL+C detected!\n"");
        e.Cancel = true;
    };
</code></pre>

<p> Note that I don't have a <code>new CancellationEventHandler</code> nor do I have to specify types of sender and e, they're inferrable from the event. Which is why this is less cumbersome to writing the whole <code>delegate (blah blah)</code> which also requires you to specify types of parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Lambdas <span class=""diff-delete"">don't</span> need to return anything</strong> and type inference is extremely powerful in context like this.</p>

<p> <span class=""diff-delete"">And</span> BTW, you can always return <strong>Lambdas that make Lambdas</strong> in the functional programming sense. For example, here's a lambda that make a lambda that handles a Button.Click event:</p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;int, int, EventHandler&gt; makeHandler =
    (dx, dy) =&gt; (sender, e) =&gt; {
        var btn = (sender as Button);
        btn.Top += dy;
        btn.Left += dx;
    };

btnUp.Click += makeHandler(0, -1);
btnDown.Click += makeHandler(0, 1);
btnLeft.Click += makeHandler(-1, 0);
btnRight.Click += makeHandler(1, 0);
</code></pre>

<p> Note the chaining: <code>(dx, dy) =&gt; (sender, e) =&gt;</code></p>

<p> Now that's why I'm happy to have taken the functional programming class :-)</p>

 <p><a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/08/business-requirements-are-bullshit.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Steve Yegge</a> talks fun but there is money to be made in working out what other people's requirements are so i'd take his article with a pinch of salt.</p> 
 <p> Requirements gathering is incredibly tough because of the manner in which communication works. Its a four step process that is lossy in each step.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li> I have an idea in my head</li> 
  <li> I transform this into words and pictures</li> 
  <li> You interpret the pictures and words</li> 
  <li> You paint an image in your own mind of what my original idea was like</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p> And humans <span class=""diff-delete"">mess</span> this up constantly, through their adorable imperfections. </p> 
 <p> Agile does right in promoting iterative development. Getting early versions out to the client is important in identifying what features are most important (what ships in 0.1 - 0.5 ish), helps to keep you both on the right track in terms of how the application will work and quickly identifies the hidden features that you <em>will</em> miss.</p> 
 <p> The two main problem scenarios are the two ends of the scales:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li><strong>Not knowing what you are doing</strong> - get some domain experts</li> 
  <li><strong>Having too many requirements</strong> - feature pit. - Question, cull (prioritise ;) ) features and use iterative development</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p> Yegge does well in pointing out that domain experts are essential to produce good requirements because they know the business and have worked in it. They can help identify the core desire of the client and will help explain how their staff will use the system and what is important to the staff. Alternatives and additions include trying to do the job yourself to get into the mindset or having a client staff member occasionally on-site, although the latter is unlikely to happen.</p> 
 <p> The feature pit is the other side, mostly full of failed government IT projects. Too much, too soon, not enough thought or application of realism (but what do you expect they have only about four years to make themselves feel important?). The aim here is to work out what the customer <em>really</em> wants. As long as you work on getting the core components correct, efficient and bug-free clients usually remain tolerant of missing features that arrive in later shipments, as long as they eventually arrive. This is where iterative development really helps.</p> 
 <p> Remember to separate the client's ideas of what the program will be like and what they want the program to <em>achieve</em>. Some clients can create confusion by communicating their requirements in the form of application features which may be poorly thought out or made redundant by much simpler functionality then they think they require. While I'm not advocating calling the client an idiot or not listening to them I feel that it is worth forever asking <em>why</em> they want a particular feature to get to its underlying purpose. </p> 
 <p> Remember that in either scenario it is of imperative importantance to root out the quickest path to fulfilling the customers <em>core</em> need and put you in a scenario where you are both profiting from the relationship.</p>

 <p><a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/08/business-requirements-are-bullshit.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Steve Yegge</a> talks fun but there is money to be made in working out what other people's requirements are so i'd take his article with a pinch of salt.</p> 
 <p> Requirements gathering is incredibly tough because of the manner in which communication works. Its a four step process that is lossy in each step.</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li> I have an idea in my head</li> 
  <li> I transform this into words and pictures</li> 
  <li> You interpret the pictures and words</li> 
  <li> You paint an image in your own mind of what my original idea was like</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p> And humans <span class=""diff-add"">fuck</span> this up constantly, through their adorable imperfections. </p> 
 <p> Agile does right in promoting iterative development. Getting early versions out to the client is important in identifying what features are most important (what ships in 0.1 - 0.5 ish), helps to keep you both on the right track in terms of how the application will work and quickly identifies the hidden features that you <em>will</em> miss.</p> 
 <p> The two main problem scenarios are the two ends of the scales:</p> 
 <ul> 
  <li><strong>Not knowing what<span class=""diff-add""> the fuck</span> you are doing</strong> - get some domain experts</li> 
  <li><strong>Having too many requirements</strong> - feature pit. - Question, cull (prioritise ;) ) features and use iterative development</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p> Yegge does well in pointing out that domain experts are essential to produce good requirements because they know the business and have worked in it. They can help identify the core desire of the client and will help explain how their staff will use the system and what is important to the staff. Alternatives and additions include trying to do the job yourself to get into the mindset or having a client staff member occasionally on-site, although the latter is unlikely to happen.</p> 
 <p> The feature pit is the other side, mostly full of failed government IT projects. Too much, too soon, not enough thought or application of realism (but what do you expect they have only about four years to make themselves feel important?). The aim here is to work out what the customer <em>really</em> wants. As long as you work on getting the core components correct, efficient and bug-free clients usually remain tolerant of missing features that arrive in later shipments, as long as they eventually arrive. This is where iterative development really helps.</p> 
 <p> Remember to separate the client's ideas of what the program will be like and what they want the program to <em>achieve</em>. Some clients can create confusion by communicating their requirements in the form of application features which may be poorly thought out or made redundant by much simpler functionality then they think they require. While I'm not advocating calling the client an idiot or not listening to them I feel that it is worth forever asking <em>why</em> they want a particular feature to get to its underlying purpose. </p>

<p> This works by choosing 130 bits from a cryptographically secure random bit generator, and encoding them in base-32. 128 bits is considered to be cryptographically <em>strong,</em> but each digit in a base 32 number can encode 5 bits, so 128 is rounded up to the next multiple of 5. This encoding is compact and efficient, with 5 random bits per character. Compare this to a random UUID, which only has 3.4 bits per character in standard layout, and only 122 random bits in total.</p>

<p> If you allow session identifiers to be easily guessable (too short, flawed random number generator, etc.), attackers can hijack other's sessions. Note that <code>SecureRandom</code> objects are expensive to initialize, so you'll want to keep one around and reuse it.</p>

<p> Here is alternative code for cheap, insecure random alpha-numeric strings. You can tweak the ""symbols"" if you want to use more characters.</p>

                <p> No, not quite.</p>

<p> Firstly, there's a slight difference in semantics. If <code>a</code> is <code>null</code>, then <code>a.concat(b)</code> <span class=""diff-delete"">results in </span><code><span class=""diff-delete"">NullPointerException</span></code> but <code>a+=b</code> will treat the original value of <code>a</code> as if it were <code>null</code>. Furthermore, the <code>concat()</code> method only accepts <code>String</code> values while the <code>+</code> operator will silently convert the argument to a String (using the <code>toString()</code> method for objects). So the <code>concat()</code> method is more strict in what it accepts.</p>

<p> To look under the hood, write a simple class with a += b;</p>

<pre><code>public class Concat {
    String cat(String a, String b) {

<p> The <code>concat</code> method should be faster. However, with more strings the <code>StringBuilder</code> method wins, at least in terms of performance.</p>

<p> The source code of <code>String</code> and <code>StringBuilder</code> (and its package-private base class) is available in src.zip of the Sun JDK.

                <p> No, not quite.</p>

<p> Firstly, there's a slight difference in semantics. If <code>a</code> is <code>null</code>, then <code>a.concat(b)</code> <span class=""diff-add"">NPEs</span> but <code>a+=b</code> will treat the original value of <code>a</code> as if it were <code>null</code>. Furthermore, the <code>concat()</code> method only accepts <code>String</code> values while the <code>+</code> operator will silently convert the argument to a String (using the <code>toString()</code> method for objects). So the <code>concat()</code> method is more strict in what it accepts.</p>

<p> To look under the hood, write a simple class with a += b;</p>

<pre><code>public class Concat {
    String cat(String a, String b) {
        a += b;
        return a;
    }

 <ol> 
  <li> Given your particular report layout, count the maximum number of rows per page. Let us say that this is 40.</li> 
  <li> Set up a counter to count the rows within the page (as opposed to rows within the whole report). You could do this either by event script or by a CalcTotal component.</li> 
  <li> Define an OnBeforePrint scripted event handler for the main data band.</li> 
  <li> In this event handler set the FinishNewPage property of the main data band to be True when the row-per-page count is one or two below the max (in our example, this would be 38). And set it to False in all other cases. The effect of this is to give every page a non-zero number of widows (in this case 1..38), thus avoiding the condition that gives rise to the Rave Endless loop problem.</li>

 <p> What is GNU Screen? Great!</p> 
 <p> Erm, a slightly more useful answer: it allows you to run multiple console applications, or commands, in one terminal. Kind of like a tabbed terminal emulator. In fact, that's exactly what it is (just not done with the regular GUI toolkits)</p> 
 <p> Why is it so great? Simple, you can run a program in a screen session (Run <code>screen</code> and it runs your default shell, run <code>screen myapp</code> and it runs myapp in the session), hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> (the screen control sequence) and then press <kbd>d</kbd> (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>,<kbd>d</kbd>) to detach.</p> 
 <p> The program keeps running in the background, <em>but</em>, unlike doing <code>mycmd &amp;</code>, you can run <code>screen -r</code> to reattach the session, and everything is as you left it. You can send input to the command, if it's a curses UI, everything still works just like if it were a ""real"" terminal.</p> 
 <p> It's very popular with console IRC clients - you can run (say) <code>screen irssi</code> and reattach the session from anywhere you can SSH from.</p>

 <p> As a purely practical matter, you may want to avoid certain characters.

 <p> For example, the HTML declaration <code>&lt;div id=""first.name""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> is valid. You can select that element in CSS as <code>#first\.name</code> and in jQuery like so: <code>$('#first\\.name').</code> But if you forget the backslash, <code>$('#first.name')</code>, you will have a perfectly valid selector looking for an element with id <code>first</code> and also having class <code>name</code>. This is a bug that is easy to overlook. You might be happier<span class=""diff-delete"">,</span> in the long run<span class=""diff-delete"">,</span> choosing the id <code>first-name</code> (a hyphen rather than a period), instead.</p> 
 <p> You can simplify your development tasks by strictly sticking to a naming convention. For example, if you limit yourself entirely to lower-case characters and always separate words with either hyphens or underscores (but not both, pick one and never use the other), then you have an easy-to-remember pattern. You will never wonder ""was it <code>firstName</code> or <code>FirstName</code>?"" because you will always know that you should type <code>first_name</code>. Prefer camel case? Then limit yourself to that, no hyphens or underscores, and always, consistently use either upper-case or lower-case for the first character, don't mix them.</p>

 <p> The performance problem here is the cost of creating a new function object at each iteration of the loop and not the fact that you use an anonymous function:</p> 
 <pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {    
    myObjects[i].onMyEvent = function() {
        // do something    
    };
}
</code></pre> 
 <p> You are creating a thousand distinct function objects even though they have the same body of code and no binding to the lexical scope (<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+closure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">closure</a>). The following seems faster, on the other hand, because it simply assigns the <em>same</em> function reference to the array elements throughout the loop:</p> 
 <pre><code>function myEventHandler() {
    // do something
}

for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {
    myObjects[i].onMyEvent = myEventHandler;
}
</code></pre> 
 <p> If you were to create the anonymous function before entering the loop, then only assign references to it to the array elements while inside the loop, you will find that there is no performance or semantic difference whatsoever when compared to the named function version:</p> 
 <pre><code>var handler = function() {
    // do something    
};
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++i) {    
    myObjects[i].onMyEvent = handler;
}
</code></pre> 
 <p> In short, there is no observable performance cost to using anonymous over named functions.</p> 
 <p> As an aside, it may appear from above that there is no difference between:</p> 
 <pre><code>function myEventHandler() { /* ... */ }
</code></pre> 
 <p> and:</p> 
 <pre><code>var myEventHandler = function() { /* ... */ }
</code></pre> 
 <p> The former is a <em>function declaration</em> whereas the latter is a variable assignment to an anonymous function. Although they may appear to have the same effect, JavaScript does treat them slightly differently. To understand the difference, I recommend reading, â<a href=""http://www.dustindiaz.com/javascript-function-declaration-ambiguity/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JavaScript function declaration ambiguity</a>â?.</p>

 <p> Bad news: all of the answers had some quirks or didn't work quite right (or at all). I've added a comment to each of your posts.</p> 
 <p> Good news: I've found a way to make it work. This solution is pretty straightforward and seems to work in all the scenarios (mousing down, selecting text, tabbing focus, etc.)</p> 
 <pre><code>bool alreadyFocused;

textBox1.GotFocus += textBox1_GotFocus;
textBox1.MouseUp += textBox1_MouseUp;
textBox1.Leave += textBox1_Leave;

...

void textBox1_Leave(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    alreadyFocused = false;
}


void textBox1_GotFocus(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Select all text only if the mouse isn't down.
    // This makes tabbing to the textbox give focus.
    if (MouseButtons == MouseButtons.None)
    {
        this.textBox1.SelectAll();
        alreadyFocused = true;
    }
}

void textBox1_MouseUp(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    // Web browsers like Google Chrome select the text on mouse up.
    // They only do it if the textbox isn't already focused,
    // and if the user hasn't selected all text.

 <p> As far as I can tell, this causes a <code><span class=""diff-delete"">TextBox</span></code> to behave exactly like a web browser's address bar.</p> 
 <p> Hopefully this helps the next guy<span class=""diff-delete"">/gal</span> who tries to solve this deceptively simple problem.</p>

 <p> My initial reaction was '#ifdef, of course', but I think #if actually has some significant advantages for this - here's why:</p> 
 <p> First, you can use 'DEBUG_ENABLED' in preprocessor <em><span class=""diff-delete"">and</span></em> compiled tests. Example - Often, I want longer timeouts when debug is enabled, so using #if, I can write this</p> 
 <pre><code>  DoSomethingSlowWithTimeout(DEBUG_ENABLED? 5000 : 1000);
</code></pre> 
 <p>... instead of ...</p> 
 <pre><code>#ifdef DEBUG_MODE
  DoSomethingSlowWithTimeout(5000);
#else

</code></pre> 
 <p> Second, you're in a better position if you want to migrate from a #define to a global constant. #defines are usually frowned on by most C++ programmers.</p> 
 <p> And, Third, you say you've a divide in your team. My guess is this means different members have already adopted different approaches, and you need to standardise. Ruling that #if is the preferred choice means that code using #ifdef will compile -and run- even when DEBUG_ENABLED is false. And it's <em>much</em> easier to track down and remove debug output that is produced when it shouldn't be than vice-versa.</p> 
 <p> Oh, and a minor readability point. You should be able to use true/false rather than 0/1 in your #define, and because the value is a single lexical token, it's the one time you don't need parentheses around it. </p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>

<p><strong>A TCP socket is an endpoint <em>instance</em></strong> defined by an IP address and a port in the context of either a particular TCP connection or the listening state. </p>

<p><strong>A port is a virtualisation identifier</strong> defining a service endpoint (as distinct from a service <em>instance</em> endpoint aka session identifier). </p>

<p><strong>A TCP socket is <em>not</em> a connection</strong>, it is the endpoint of a specific connection.</p>

<p><strong>There can be concurrent connections to a service endpoint</strong>, because a connection is identified by <em>both its local and remote</em> endpoints, allowing traffic to be routed to a specific service instance.</p>

<p><strong>There can only be one listener socket for a given address/port combination</strong>.</p>

<h2>Exposition</h2>

<p> This was an interesting question that forced me to re-examine a number of things I thought I knew inside out. You'd think a name like ""socket"" would be self-explanatory: it was obviously chosen to evoke imagery of the endpoint into which you plug a network cable, there being strong functional parallels. Nevertheless, in network parlance the word ""socket"" carries so much baggage that a careful re-examination is necessary.</p>

<p> In the broadest possible sense, a port is a point of ingress or egress. Ports, then, are transportation endpoints whether you ship data or big steel containers. </p>

<p> For the purpose of this discussion I will limit consideration to the context of TCP-IP networks. The OSI model is all very well but has never been completely implemented, much less widely deployed in high-traffic high-stress conditions.</p>

<p> The combination of an IP address and a port is strictly known as an endpoint and is sometimes called a socket. This usage originates with RFC793, the original TCP specification.</p>

<p> A TCP <em>connection</em> is defined by two endpoints aka <em>sockets</em>.</p>

<p> An endpoint (socket) is defined by the combination of a network address and a <em>port</em> identifier. Note that address/port does <em>not</em> completely identify a socket (more on this later).</p>

<p> The purpose of ports is to differentiate multiple endpoints on a given network address. You could say that a port is a virtualised endpoint. This virtualisation makes multiple concurrent connections on a single network interface possible. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p> It is the socket pair (the 4-tuple
  consisting of the client IP address,
  client port number, server IP address,
  and server port number) that specifies
  the two endpoints that uniquely
  identifies each TCP connection in an
  internet. (<em>TCP-IP Illustrated Volume 1</em>, W. Richard Stevens)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> In most C-derived lanaguages, TCP connections are established and manipulated using methods on an instance of a Socket class. Although it is common to operate on a higher level of abstraction, typically an instance of a NetworkStream class, this generally exposes a reference to a socket object. To the coder this socket object appears to represent the connection because the connection is created and manipulated using methods of the socket object. </p>

<p> In C#, to establish a TCP connection (to an existing listener) first you create a <em>TcpClient</em>. If you don't specify an endpoint to the <em>TcpClient</em> constructor it uses defaults - one way or another the local endpoint is defined. Then you invoke the <em>Connect</em> 
method on the instance you've created. This method requires a parameter describing the other endpoint.</p>

<p> All this is a bit confusing and leads you to believe that a socket is a connection, which is bollocks. I was labouring under this misapprehension until Richard Dorman asked the question.</p>

<p> Having done a lot of reading and thinking, I'm now convinced that it would make a lot more sense to have a class <em>TcpConnection</em> with a constructor that takes two arguments, <em>LocalEndpoint</em> and <em>RemoteEndpoint</em>. You could probably support a single argument <em>RemoteEndpoint</em> when defaults are acceptable for the local endpoint. This is ambiguous on multihomed computers, but the ambiguity can be resolved using the routing table by selecting the interface with the shortest route to the remote endpoint.</p>

<p> Clarity would be enhanced in other respects, too. A socket is <em>not</em> identified by the combination of IP address and port:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p> [...]TCP demultiplexes incoming segments using all four values that comprise the local and foreign addresses: destination IP address, destination port number, source IP address, and source port number. TCP cannot determine which process gets an incoming segment by looking at the destination port only. Also, the only one of the [various] endpoints at [a given port number] that will receive incoming connection requests is the one in the listen state. (p255, <em>TCP-IP Illustrated Volume 1</em>, W. Richard Stevens)</p>
</blockquote>

<p> As you can see, it is not just possible but quite likely for a network service to have numerous sockets with the same address/port, but only one listener socket on a particular address/port combination. Use of a socket object as a proxy for a TCP connection is thus <em>very</em> misleading.</p>

If you just want to bundle everything you dont need to create a standalone executable, you could easily create an installer:</p>

 <p> That's a guide on how to distribute your software when it's done.</p>

SYNOPSIS
     #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

     u_int32_t
     arc4random(void);

     void
     arc4random_stir(void);

     void
     arc4random_addrandom(unsigned char *dat, int datlen);

DESCRIPTION
     The arc4random() function uses the key stream generator employed by the arc4 cipher, which uses 8*8 8
     bit S-Boxes.  The S-Boxes can be in about (2**1700) states.  The arc4random() function returns pseudo-
     random numbers in the range of 0 to (2**32)-1, and therefore has twice the range of rand(3) and
     random(3).

     The arc4random_stir() function reads data from /dev/urandom and uses it to permute the S-Boxes via
     arc4random_addrandom().

     There is no need to call arc4random_stir() before using arc4random(), since arc4random() automatically
     initializes itself.

EXAMPLES
     The following produces a drop-in replacement for the traditional rand() and random() functions using
     arc4random():

           #define foo4random() (arc4random() % ((unsigned)RAND_MAX + 1))

Please do not use it unless necessary.</span></p><span class=""diff-delete"">

</span><hr><span class=""diff-delete"">

</span><p><span class=""diff-delete""> As the [former]</span> maintainer of ExtUtils::MakeMaker, I like to recommend Module::Build because MakeMaker is a horror show and I don't want to maintain it any more.  Module::Build is so much better put together.  But those aren't your concerns and I'll present my ""least hassle for you"" answer.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary:</h2>

<p> Because Module::Build support is not 100% in place through all of Perl, start with MakeMaker.  If you want to do any customization at all, switch to Module::Build.  Since their basic layout, options and interface are almost identical this will be painless.  As seductive as it looks, avoid Module::Install.</p>

<p> Fortunately, Module::Build can emulate MakeMaker which helps some, but doesn't help if you're going to do any customization.  See <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Build::Compat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Module::Build::Compat</a>.</p>

<p> For CPAN releases using Module::Build is fine.  There's enough Module::Build stuff on CPAN now that everyone's dealt with getting it bootstrapped already.</p>

            </div>","<div class=""post-text"">
                <p> As the maintainer of ExtUtils::MakeMaker, I like to recommend Module::Build because MakeMaker is a horror show and I don't want to maintain it any more.  Module::Build is so much better put together.  But those aren't your concerns and I'll present my ""least hassle for you"" answer.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary:</h2>

<p> Because Module::Build support is not 100% in place through all of Perl, start with MakeMaker.  If you want to do any customization at all, switch to Module::Build.  Since their basic layout, options and interface are almost identical this will be painless.  As seductive as it looks, avoid Module::Install.</p>

<p> Fortunately, Module::Build can emulate MakeMaker which helps some, but doesn't help if you're going to do any customization.  See <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Module::Build::Compat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Module::Build::Compat</a>.</p>

<p> For CPAN releases using Module::Build is fine.  There's enough Module::Build stuff on CPAN now that everyone's dealt with getting it bootstrapped already.</p>

<p> Finally, the new <a href=""http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec.html#configure_requires"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>configure_requires</code></a> option lets CPAN shells know to install Module::Build before they can start building the module.

                <p> Just for the sake of completeness, here's a brain dump of related information.</p>

<p> As others have noted, <code>string</code> is an alias for <code>System.String</code>. They compile to the same code, so at execution time there is no difference whatsoever. This is just one of the aliases in C#. The complete list is:</p>

<pre><code>object:  System.Object
string:  System.String
bool:    System.Boolean
byte:    System.Byte
sbyte:   System.SByte
short:   System.Int16
ushort:  System.UInt16
int:     System.Int32
uint:    System.UInt32
long:    System.Int64
ulong:   System.UInt64
float:   System.Single
double:  System.Double
decimal: System.Decimal
char:    System.Char
</code></pre>

<p> Apart from <code>string</code>, <code>object</code>, the aliases are all to value types. <code>decimal</code> is a value type, but not a primitive type in the CLR. The only primitive type which doesn't have an alias is <code>System.IntPtr</code>.</p>

<p> In the spec, the value type aliases are known as ""simple types"". Literals can be used for constant values of every simple type; no other value types have literal forms available. (Compare this with VB, which allows <code>DateTime</code> literals, and has an alias for it too.)</p>

<p> There is one circumstance in which you <em>have</em> to use the aliases: when explicitly specifying an enum's underlying type. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>public enum Foo : UInt32 {} // Invalid
public enum Bar : uint   {} // Valid
</code></pre>

<p> Finally, when it comes to which to use: personally I use the aliases everywhere for the implementation, but the CLR type for any APIs. It really doesn't matter too much which you use in terms of implementation - consistency among your team is nice, but no-one else is going to care. On the other hand, it's genuinely important that if you refer to a type in an API, you do so in a language neutral way. A method called <code><span class=""diff-delete"">""ReadInt32"" is unambiguous</span></code>, whereas a method called <span class=""diff-delete"">""</span><code><span class=""diff-delete"">ReadInt</span></code><span class=""diff-delete"">""</span> requires interpretation. The caller could be using a language which defines an ""int"" alias for Int16, for example.

 <p> There are two limits, both not enforced by C++ but rather by the hardware.</p> 
 <p> The first limit (should never be reached) is set by the restrictions of the size type used to describe an index in the array (and the size thereof). It is given by the maximum value the system's <code>std::size_t</code> can take. This data type should always be the largest integer type of a system.</p> 
 <p> The other limit is a physical memory limit. The larger your objects in the array are, the sooner this limit is reached because memory is full. For example, a <code>vector&lt;int&gt;</code> of a given size <em>n</em> typically takes about four times as much memory as an array of type <code>vector&lt;char&gt;</code> (minus a small constant value). Therefore, a <code>vector&lt;char&gt;</code> may contain more items than a <code>vector&lt;int&gt;</code> before memory is full. The same counts for the native C-style arrays <code>int[]</code> and <code>char[]</code>.</p> 
 <p> Additionally, this upper limit may be influenced by the type of <code>allocator</code> used to construct the <code>vector</code> because an <code>allocator</code> is free to manage memory any way it wants. A very odd but nontheless conceivable allocator could pool memory in such a way that identical instances of an object share resources. This way, you could insert a lot of identical objects into a container that would otherwise use up all the available memory.</p> 
 <p><span class=""diff-delete""> Also this can hit the program </span><code><span class=""diff-delete"">stack</span></code><span class=""diff-delete""> size limits, but you can change this limit later, so it is a good practice if you have big data to use </span><code><span class=""diff-delete"">dynamic allocation</span></code><span class=""diff-delete""> (on the </span><code><span class=""diff-delete"">heap</span></code><span class=""diff-delete"">).</span></p>

</span><pre><code><span class=""diff-delete"">Class path entries can contain the basename wildcard character *, which is
considered equivalent to specifying a list of all the files in the directory
with the extension .jar or .JAR. For example, the class path entry foo/*
specifies all JAR files in the directory named foo. A classpath entry
consisting simply of * expands to a list of all the jar files in the current
directory.

A class path entry that contains * will not match class files. To
match both classes and JAR files in a single directory foo, use either
foo;foo/* or foo/*;foo. The order chosen determines whether the classes and
resources in foo are loaded before JAR files in foo, or vice
versa.

Subdirectories are not searched recursively. For example, foo/* looks
for JAR files only in foo, not in foo/bar, foo/baz, etc.

The order in which
the JAR files in a directory are enumerated in the expanded class path is not
specified and may vary from platform to platform and even from moment to moment
on the same machine. A well-constructed application should not depend upon any
particular order. If a specific order is required then the JAR files can be
enumerated explicitly in the class path.

Expansion of wildcards is done early,
prior to the invocation of a program's main method, rather than late, during
the class-loading process itself. Each element of the input class path
containing a wildcard is replaced by the (possibly empty) sequence of elements
generated by enumerating the JAR files in the named directory. For example, if
the directory foo contains a.jar, b.jar, and c.jar, then the class path foo/*
is expanded into foo/a.jar;foo/b.jar;foo/c.jar, and that string would be the
value of the system property java.class.path.

The CLASSPATH environment
variable is not treated any differently from the -classpath (or -cp)
command-line option. That is, wildcards are honored in all these cases.
However, class path wildcards are not honored in the Class-Path jar-manifest
header.

<p><strong>Crockford</strong> suggests that you ""go with the grain"", or write javascript in a way that corresponds to javascript's prototypal nature.</p>

<p> Of course, he goes on to show that the original model that Netscape suggested is actually broken.  He labels it ""pseudoclassical"", and points out a lot of the misdirection and unnecessary complexity that is involved in following that model.</p>

<p> He wrote the ""object"" function as a remedy (now known as Object.create() ).  It allows for some very powerful prototypal patterns.</p>

<p> It's not always easy to do develop a clean interface when you have to work with legacy javascript, especially not when you're dealing with large systems which usually include multiple libraries, each implementing a different pattern.  In general, I'd say that the ""right way"" is the one which allows you to write a clean interface which behaves well in the context of your legacy code, but also allows you to refactor and eliminate old dependencies over time.</p>

<p> Considering the differences between the major library patterns, I've found that the most successful route to take in my own work is to keep my interfaces independent of the libraries entirely.  I'll use a library or module if it's helpful, but won't be bound to it.  This has allowed me to refactor a lot of code, phase out some libraries, and use libraries as scaffolding which can be optimized later.</p>

<p> Along these lines, I've written interfaces that were inspired by Crockford's parasitic inheritance pattern.  It's really a win for simplicity.</p>

<p> On the other side of the coin, I'm sure you could argue for picking a library, enforcing it across your team, and conforming to its patterns.</p>

 <p> If by ""change the appearance of the base class"" you mean ""provide a new template"", then what you need is probably a CustomControl not a UserControl.</p> 
 <p> The best way to accomplish this is to follow the example set by other Microsoft controls, such as Button or ListBox:</p> 
 <ol> 
  <li> Create a class that derives directly from Control (or whatever is closest to your control).</li> 
  <li> If any properties will need to be exposed to the control (such as text on a button, for example), make sure that you properly define them as DependencyProperties.</li> 
  <li> As described <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms745025.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, create a ResourceDictionary called Themes/generic.xaml and add a style for your class that includes a template (don't give the style a key).</li> 
  <li> Use TemplateBindings for any properties of elements on your control that need to get values from your control.</li> 
  <li> If you'll need to attach any event handlers to elements in your template, give them a unique name. Microsoft uses the convention of prefixing these names with ""PART_"", and I think it's a good thing to do for the sake of consistency, but it's not strictly required.</li> 
  <li> Again, if you need to attach event handlers, overload OnApplyTemplate(). In this method, you should detach any old event handlers (we certainly don't want any memory leaks!), and look for elements that have the names your provided in your template--when you find them, attach event handlers, as necessary.</li> 
 </ol> 
 <p> This is certainly much more work than simply deriving from UserControl, but if you want to be able to totally re-template controls, like you can with the built-in controls, this is the way to do it.</p> 
 <p><em>On the other hand</em>, if all you want to do is to provide a certain amount of limited customization, such as changing the background, or associating a Command with some user action, then the best thing to do is to expose DependencyProperties, which can then be set in styles for your control, or on instances of your control, itself.</p> 
 <p> In the case you mentioned of wanting to customize the look in an inherited control, the process is pretty similar: just add a default style for the new control with a new template; if you need to add more event handlers, just be absolutely certain that you call base.OnApplyTemplate(). <span class=""diff-delete"">.</span></p>

                <p> I see two answers with good qualities, each with a small flaw, so I will give my take on it:</p>

<pre><code>if not os.path.exists(directory):
    os.makedirs(directory)

<p> As noted in comments and elsewhere, there's a <span class=""diff-delete"">rare</span> condition - if the directory is created between the <code>os.path.exists</code> and the <code>os.makedirs</code> calls, the <code>os.makedirs</code> will fail with an <code>OSError</code>. Unfortunately, blanket-catching <code>OSError</code> and continuing is not foolproof, as it will ignore a failure to create the directory due to other factors, such as insufficient permissions, full disk, etc.</p>

<p> One option would be to trap the <code>OSError</code> and examine the embedded error code, if one knew what's what (on my OS, 13 seems to indicate that permission is denied, and 17 that the file exists - it's not clear that that's even remotely portable, but is explored in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/273698/is-there-a-cross-platform-way-of-getting-information-from-pythons-oserror"">Is there a cross-platform way of getting information from Pythons OSError</a>).

<p> Depending on the application, the danger of concurrent operations may be more or less than the danger posed by other factors such as file permissions.

 <p> In a comment, lamcro observes in regard to the question of whether or not a comb box box has a Recordset:</p> 
 <blockquote> 
  <p> When I break into the forms VB code and ""Add Watch"" the CB control, the recordset property is in there. I can even enter and see it's own properties. </p> 
 </blockquote> 
 <p> I see it when I set a watch list, but the recordset of a combo box is not accessible or alterable via code. In order to filter a combo box, you need to work with its Rowsource.</p> 
 <p> This can be accomplished one of two ways:</p> 
 <ol> 
  <li> use an event to assign a new Rowsource to your combo boxes on the fly, OR</li> 
  <li> use a reference to the control whose value you want to filter on in the WHERE clause of the Rowsource of your other combo boxes.</li> 
 </ol> 
 <p> Say you have cmbComboBox1 and when you select a value in it, you want the values listed in cmbCombBox2 to be filtered according to the value selected in cmbComboBox1. For method 1, you'd use the first combo box's AfterUpdate to set the rowsource of the second:</p> 
 <pre><code>  Private Sub cmbComboBox1_AfterUpdate()
    Dim strRowsource As String

    strRowsource  = ""SELECT * FROM MyTable""
    If Not IsNull(Me!cmbComboBox1) Then
       strRowsource  = strRowsource &amp; "" WHERE MyField = "" &amp; Me!cmbComboBox1
    End If
    Me!cmbComboBox2.Rowsource = strRowsource
  End Sub
</code></pre> 
 <p> To use the second method, you'd instead define the Rowsource of the second combo box to be based on testing the value of the first:</p> 
 <pre><code>SELECT * FROM MyTable 
WHERE (MyField=[Forms]![MyForm]![cmbComboBox1] 
        AND IsNull([Forms]![MyForm]![cmbComboBox1])=False) 
   OR IsNull([Forms]![MyForm]![cmbComboBox1])=True
</code></pre> 
 <p> What this does is filter the rowsource if the first combo box has a value and <em>doesn't</em> filter it if there <em>is</em> a value. That is, you get an unfiltered list until there's a value chosen for the first combo box.</p> 
 <p> Then, in the Afterupdate event of cmbComboBox1, you'd requery the second combo box:</p> 
 <pre><code>  Private Sub cmbComboBox1_AfterUpdate()
    Me!cmbComboBox2.Requery
  End Sub
</code></pre> 
 <p> It's also probably a good idea to define a parameter in order to insure that the reference to the form control gets appropriately resolved, so your Rowsource would be this:</p> 
 <pre><code>PARAMETERS [Forms]![MyForm]![cmbComboBox1] Long;
SELECT * FROM MyTable 
WHERE (MyField=[Forms]![MyForm]![cmbComboBox1] 
        AND IsNull([Forms]![MyForm]![cmbComboBox1])=False) 
   OR IsNull([Forms]![MyForm]![cmbComboBox1])=True
</code></pre> 
 <p>(assuming you're filtering on an Autonumber PK -- if the data type is different, you'd use a different data type, of course)</p> 
 <p> I would tend to use the dynamic Rowsource assignment, simply because I've found it to be less problematic across different Access versions (i.e., references to controls on forms are not resolved the same way in all versions of Access).</p>

 <p> Immutable objects are objects that can't be changed programmatically. They're especially good for multi-threaded environments or other environments where more than one process is able to alter (mutate) the values in an object.</p> 
 <p> Just to clarify, however, StringBuilder is actually a mutable object, not an immutable one. A regular java String is immutable (meaning that once it's been created you cannot change the underlying string without changing the object).</p>

 <p> In this example, the ColoredString is said to be mutable because you can change (mutate) one of its key properties without creating a new ColoredString class.

If you have an instance of ColoredString which was created as</p> 
 <pre><code>new ColoredString(""Blue"", ""This is a blue string!"");
</code></pre> 
 <p> Then you would expect the string to always be ""Blue"". If another thread, however, got ahold of this instance and called</p> 
 <pre><code>blueString.setColor(""Red"");
</code></pre> 
 <p> You would suddenly, and probably unexpectedly, now have a ""Red"" string when you wanted a ""Blue"" one. Because of this, immutable objects are almost always preferred when passing instances of objects around.

A software implementation which does not consider all character encodings runs the risk of accepting strings considered invalid in the application design, which could cause bugs or allow attacks. The solution is to allow a single encoding for each character. Canonicalization is then the process of translating every string character to its single allowed encoding.

In this case, in a client/server context, the canonicalization would be the responsibility of the client.</p>

                <h2>Read all text from a file</h2>

<p> Here's a compact, robust idiom for Java 7, wrapped up in a utility method:</p>

<pre><code><span class=""diff-delete"">import java.nio.file.Files;

</span>static String readFile(String path, Charset encoding) throws IOException 
{
  byte[] encoded = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(path));
  return new String(encoded, encoding);

<h2>Read lines of text from a file</h2>

<p> Java 7 added a <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#readAllLines%28java.nio.file.Path,%20java.nio.charset.Charset%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">convenience method to read a file as lines of text,</a> represented as a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code>. This approach is ""lossy"" because the line separators are stripped from the end of each line.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get(path), encoding);
</code></pre>

<h2>Memory utilization</h2>

<p> The first method, that preserves line breaks, can temporarily require memory several times the size of the file, because for a short time the raw file contents (a byte array), and the decoded characters (each of which is 16 bits even if encoded as 8 bits in the file) reside in memory at once. It is safest to apply to files that you know to be small relative to the available memory.</p>

<p> The second method, reading lines, is usually more memory efficient, because the input byte buffer for decoding doesn't need to contain the entire file. However, it's still not suitable for files that are very large relative to available memory.</p>

<p> For reading large files, you need a different design for your program, one that reads a chunk of text from a stream, processes it, and then moves on to the next, reusing the same fixed-sized memory block. Here, ""large"" depends on the computer specs. Nowadays, this threshold might be many gigabytes of RAM.</p>

<h2>Character encoding</h2>

<p> One thing that is missing from the sample in the original post is the character encoding. There are some special cases where the platform default is what you want, but they are rare, and you should be able justify your choice.</p>

<p> The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/charset/StandardCharsets.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>StandardCharsets</code></a> class define some constants for the encodings required of all Java runtimes:</p>

<pre><code>String content = readFile(""test.txt"", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
</code></pre>

<p> The platform default is available from <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html#defaultCharset%28%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the <code>Charset</code> class</a> itself:</p>

<pre><code>String content = readFile(""test.txt"", Charset.defaultCharset());
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p> Note: This answer largely replaces my Java 6 version. The utility of Java 7 safely simplifies the code, and the old answer, which used a mapped byte buffer, prevented the file that was read from being deleted until the mapped buffer was garbage collected. You can view the old version via the ""edited"" link on this answer.</p>

<p> The <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/charset/StandardCharsets.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>StandardCharsets</code></a> class define some constants for the encodings required of all Java runtimes:</p>

<pre><code>String content = readFile(""test.txt"", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
</code></pre>

<p> The platform default is available from <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/charset/Charset.html#defaultCharset%28%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the <code>Charset</code> class</a> itself:</p>

<pre><code>String content = readFile(""test.txt"", Charset.defaultCharset());
</code></pre>

<p> Note: This answer largely replaces my Java 6 version. The utility of Java 7 safely simplifies the code, and the old answer, which used a mapped byte buffer, prevented the file that was read from being deleted until the mapped buffer was garbage collected. You can view the old version via the ""edited"" link on this answer.</p>

 <p> What are you doing in your method? If you're merely populating an existing array, then you don't need pass-by-reference semantics - either in .NET or in Java. In both cases, the reference will be passed by value - so changes to the <em>object</em> will be visible by the caller. That's like telling someone the address of your house and asking them to deliver something to it - no problem.</p> 
 <p> If you <em>really</em> want pass-by-reference semantics, i.e. the caller will see any changes made to the parameter itself, e.g. setting it to null or a reference to a different byte array, then either method needs to return the new value, or you need to pass a reference to some sort of ""holder"" which contains a reference to the byte array, and which can have the (possibly changed) reference grabbed from it later.</p> 
 <p> In other words, if your method looks likes this:</p> 
 <pre><code>public void doSomething(byte[] data)<span class=""diff-delete""> </span>{

/**
 * Generic component printer.  This object allows any AWT or Swing component  (or DCT system)
 * to be printed by performing it pre and post print responsibilities.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * When printing components, the role of the print method is nothing more than to scale the Graphics, turn off double
 * buffering, and call paint.  There is no particular reason to put that print method in the component being printed.  A
 * better approach is to build a generic printComponent method to which you simply pass the component you want printed.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * With Swing, almost all components have double buffering turned on by default. In general, this is a great benefit,
 * making for convenient and efficient painting. However, in the specific case of printing, it can is a huge problem.
 * First, since printing components relies on scaling the coordinate system and then simply calling the component's
 * paint method, if double buffering is enabled printing amounts to little more than scaling up the buffer (off-screen
 * image) which results in ugly low-resolution printing like you already had available. Secondly, sending these huge
 * buffers to the printer results in huge print spooler files which take a very long time to print. Consequently this
 * object globally turns off double buffering before printing and turns it back on afterwards.

/**
 * Generic component printer.  This object allows any AWT or Swing component  (or DCT system)
 * to be printed by performing it pre and post print responsibilities.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * When printing components, the role of the print method is nothing more than to scale the Graphics, turn off double
 * buffering, and call paint.  There is no particular reason to put that print method in the component being printed.  A
 * better approach is to build a generic printComponent method to which you simply pass the component you want printed.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * With Swing, almost all components have double buffering turned on by default. In general, this is a great benefit,
 * making for convenient and efficient painting. However, in the specific case of printing, it can is a huge problem.
 * First, since printing components relies on scaling the coordinate system and then simply calling the component's
 * paint method, if double buffering is enabled printing amounts to little more than scaling up the buffer (off-screen
 * image) which results in ugly low-resolution printing like you already had available. Secondly, sending these huge
 * buffers to the printer results in huge print spooler files which take a very long time to print. Consequently this
 * object globally turns off double buffering before printing and turns it back on afterwards.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Threading Design : [x] Single Threaded  [ ] Threadsafe  [ ] Immutable  [ ] Isolated

 <pre><code><span class=""diff-delete"">ThreadLocalRandom.current()</span>.<span class=""diff-delete"">nextDouble</span>() * ( Max - Min )
</code></pre> 
 <p> This returns a value in the range <code>[0,Max-Min)</code>, where 'Max-Min' is not included.</p> 
 <p> For example, if you want <code>[5,10)</code>, you need to cover five integer values so you use</p> 
 <pre><code><span class=""diff-delete"">ThreadLocalRandom.current()</span>.<span class=""diff-delete"">nextDouble</span>() * 5
</code></pre> 
 <p> This would return a value in the range <code>[0,5)</code>, where 5 is not included.</p> 
 <p> Now you need to shift this range up to the range that you are targeting. You do this by adding the Min value.</p> 
 <pre><code>Min + (<span class=""diff-delete"">ThreadLocalRandom.current()</span>.<span class=""diff-delete"">nextDouble</span>() * (Max - Min))
</code></pre> 
 <p> You now will get a value in the range <code>[Min,Max)</code>. Following our example, that means <code>[5,10)</code>:</p> 
 <pre><code>5 + (Math.random() * (10 - 5))
</code></pre> 
 <p> But, this still doesn't include <code>Max</code> and you are getting a double value. In order to get the <code>Max</code> value included, you need to add 1 to your range parameter <code>(Max - Min)</code> and then truncate the decimal part by casting to an int. This is accomplished via:</p> 
 <pre><code>Min + (int)(<span class=""diff-delete"">ThreadLocalRandom.current()</span>.<span class=""diff-delete"">nextDouble</span>() * ((Max - Min) + 1))

 <p> And there you have it. A random integer value in the range <code>[Min,Max]</code>, or per the example <code>[5,10]</code>:</p>

 <p> Everyone is suggesting MySQL fulltext search, however you should be aware of a HUGE caveat.

 <p> So you have a few options:</p> 
 <p><strong>1.</strong> The simplest approach is outlined by <a href=""http://particletree.com/notebook/ranked-searches-with-sql/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Particle Tree</a>. You can actaully get ranked searches off of pure SQL (no fulltext, no nothing). The SQL query below will search a table and rank results based off the number of occurrences of a string in the search fields:</p> 
 <pre><code>SELECT
    SUM(((LENGTH(p.body) - LENGTH(REPLACE(p.body, 'term', '')))/4) +
        ((LENGTH(p.body) - LENGTH(REPLACE(p.body, 'search', '')))/6))
    AS Occurrences
FROM
    posts AS p
GROUP BY
    p.id
ORDER BY
    Occurrences DESC
</code></pre> 
 <p><em>edited their example to provide a bit more clarity</em></p> 
 <p> Variations on the above SQL query, adding WHERE statements (WHERE p.body LIKE '%whatever%you%want'), etc. will probably get you exactly what you need.</p> 
 <p><strong>2.</strong> You can alter your database schema to support full text. Often what is done to keep the InnoDB referential integrity, ACID compliance, and speed without having to install plugins like <a href=""http://www.sphinxsearch.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sphinx Fulltext Search Engine</a> for MySQL is to split the quote data into it's own table. Basically you would have a table Quotes that is an InnoDB table that, rather than having your TEXT field ""data"" you have a reference ""quote_data_id"" which points to the ID on a Quote_Data table which is a MyISAM table. You can do your fulltext on the MyISAM table, join the IDs returned with your InnoDB tables and voila you have your results.</p> 
 <p><strong>3.</strong> Install <a href=""http://www.sphinxsearch.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sphinx</a>. Good luck with this one.</p> 
 <p> Given what you described, I would <strong>HIGHLY</strong> recommend you take the 1st approach I presented since you have a simple database driven site. The 1st solution is simple, gets the job done quickly. Lucene will be a bitch to setup especially if you want to integrate it with the database as Lucene is designed mainly to index files not databases. Google custom site search just makes your site lose tons of reputation (makes you look amateurish and hacked), and MySQL fulltext will most likely cause you to alter your database schema.</p>
